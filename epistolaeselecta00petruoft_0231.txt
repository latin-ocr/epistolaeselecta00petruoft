Fam. iv. 12 [5 January 1342]

¹ PAGE 22. Giacomo Colonna died at Lombez in September 1341. In
Fam. v. 7, Petrarch describes a dream he had about his death a few days
before the actual event. ⁵

With this account of Giacomo we may compare the Canzone ⁴ Ο aspettata
in ciel . . .’, addressed possibly to the Bishop on the occasion of the crusade
proposed by the King of F rance in 1333 (but see Lisoni, A chi ὲ indirizzata
la canzone ‘ 0 aspectata in ciel', Parma, 1895), the sonnet‚ Rime xl, pro-
bably sent to Giacomo, and the sonnet, Rime cccxxii, written after his death.

Line 17. Stefano Colonna the elder had been exiled from Rome by
Pope Boniface VIII, on the occasion of the Pope's crusade against the
Colonna family referred to by Dante, Ins. xxvii. 8 5-111. Stefano lived in
exile at the Court of the King of F rance.

65-6. Quod iter ego secum egi z i. e. in 1330. See the note *to Fam. i. 4.

Fam. v. 1 [29 May 1343]

PAGE 25. For Barbato see the note to Fam. iv. 8.

Robert, king of Naples from 1309 to 1343, was greatly admired by
Petrarch. Petrarch was anxious to have his approval before going to
' Rome to receive the laurel. There are many passages in his praise in
Petrarch’s works, and the loss to Naples and Italy caused by his death is
the subject of many letters. His high opinion of Robert was shared by
most of his contemporaries, although they accuse him of fflarioe (e. g.
Villani and Boccaccio). As leader of the Guelf party, he was the chief
opponent of Henry VII during his visit to Italy. This and the fact that he
had ousted his nephew, Charles Martel's son, from the throne of Naples,
accounts for much of Eante’s adverse criticism of him (see Dante, Par.
viii). Gregorovius (Hissiory of Rome in the Middle Ages, vol. vi, p. 226)
forms a very low estimate of the virtues and abilities of this prince. But
see R. Caggeset-koberto d’Angib e i suoi tempi. Vol. I, Florence, 1922. Cf. on
all the letters relating to Robert and his family G. de Blasiis, Racconti di
storia Napoletana, Naples, 1908, p. 193 seq. See also Siragusa, L’Ingegno,
il sapere . . . di Roberto, Palermo, 1891.

Petrarch wrote two metrical epistles on the occasion of Robert's death
(ii. 8, 9).

Line 8. reginae iunioris novique regis: joan, the granddaughter of
King Robert, and her husband, Andrew of Hungary (see Fam. v. 3).

8-9. reginae alterius: Sancha of Aragon, King Robert’s second wife.
She retired to a convent, where she died in 1345.

24. duces. Fracassetti suggests the second one may be Convenevole da
Prato, Petrarch's schoolmaster (cf. Sen. xvi. 1, pp. 201—2). But he had been
dead for several years. See G. Giani, Ser Convenevole da Prata, Prato, 1913.
Probably he is referring either to Giacomo Colonna, who died in September
