220 NOTES

Fam. vii. r [11 September 1347]

PAGE 42. Andrew of Hungary‚ the husband of Joan I of Naples (see the
notes to Fam. v. 3), had been murdered in 1345, and Joan had married .'.'
Louis of Taranto‚ another prince of the Angevin family. In 134Jffiouis,
King of Hungary‚ entered Italy with an army with the avowed intention
of avenging the murder of his brother Andrew. He was allowed to pass
through the different states of Italy and soon established himself as King of
Naples. He based his claim on his descent from King Robert’s elder
brother, Charles Martel.

For Barbato see the note to Fam. iv. 8. Sulmo was captured after
a prolonged siege on the zoth October 1347. At the time the lette‘r was
written Louis had not yet invaded the Kingdom of Naples. He entered it in
December. The letter appears to have been written at Avignon or Vaucluse‚
while 29¹³ di Rienzo was still Tribune at Rome, and we see that Petrarch
was already contemplating his journey to Rome. The house to which he
invites Barbato was at Parma. He refers to this house in the Letter to
Posterity3 he had bought it probably in 1344 (see Fam. iv. 9, note). The
invitation could not be accepted, and apparently the two friends ἕνα· met
afterwards.

66. Nec is restored from the Basle edition.

Epist. sine Tit. 14 [1347 ?]

PAGE 44. The book of Epistolae sine Titulo consists of some twenty letters,
all undated and mostly unaddressed. Three of them are written to Cola di
Rienzo, and one to the Roman people dealing with Cola’s revolution.
Among the rest one is addressed to Boccaccio‚ two to Nelli, and one to
Lapo da Castiglionchio. The majority are concerned with the iniquities
of the Papal Court at Avignon. The condemnation of the new ‘ Babylon '
is most bank, and for that reason Petrarch thought it prudent not to
circulate the letters. Their tone may be compared with the four sonnets ·
about Avignon‚ Rime cxxxvi-cxxxix On these Letters‚ see G. Brizzolara‚
Le sine titulo del P.‚ in ‘ studi storici '‚ vol. iv, 1895, pp. 1-40, 447—71.

It has been suggested that the present letter was written to Ildebrando de'
Conti, Bishop of Padua. We know that Petrarch was intimate with him (see

Fam. xvi. 2). Petrarch addresses him as ‘ pater optime ’‚ his usual mode of
addressing a bishop or cardinal, and speaks of ‘ Patavium tuum ’. Also we

know that Ildebrando made several long journeys on affairs of the Church·
He died in November 1352. The letter would be written in 1347 or 1348,
possibly from Parma, when the Bishop first settled in Padua after his
journeys. In G. B. Baldelli‚ Del P. e delle sue opere, Florence, 1797, p. 217,
it is stated that in a manuscript of the fourteenth century Ep. sine Tit. 8
is addressed to Ildebrando.

Fracassetti did not include the Epist. s. T. in his edition ; the text of this
letter is that of the Basle edition, collated with the Venice edition of 1501.
