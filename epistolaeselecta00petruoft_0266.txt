250 NOTES

Sen. vi. 1 [24 January 1367]

PAGE 158. For Leontius see the note to Sen. iii. 6. In that letter we have s-·

seen that he Qenoff 101· Constantinople in the autumn 01 1363. His death i>

must have taken place in 1365 or 1366, and the present letter have been ς’

written in january 1367. In another letter to Boccaccio‚ Sen.iv. 2, Petrarch

¹acknowledges the arrival 01 the translation. The manuscript 01 Petrarch’s ·’ >

Α copy 01 the translation is still in existence at Paris. (See P. de Nolhac, P. et
l'humanisme, 1907, tom. ii, p. 165 seq.) ⁴

Line 1. The three letters are Sen. v. 1, 2, 3.

2. For Pavia (Ticinum) see Sen. v. 1.

6. For Donatus see Sen. xi. 2, note, l. 59.

10-11. This possibly refers to the complaint about Donatus at the end -·

01 Sen. v. 1, in connexion with the extract from Homer. ι ,
52-3. Capaneus, Tullus Hostilius, the Roman king (Livy i. 31), and ’
Carus, the Emperor (Hist. August), were all struck dead by lightning. ,
59. De Nolhac, op. cit.‚ torn. ii, p. 165, suggests that if Leontius brought f
these manuscripts they may be the Greek works to which Boccaccio refers,

‘ alios quosdam Graecos in Etruriam revocavi ’ (De geneal. deor. gent. xv. 7). ”

Sen. vii. 1 [29 June 1366]

PAGE 160. Only a small portion 01 this enormous letter to Urban V is here Ι ι
given. It is one 01 the finest 01 Petrarch’ s letters, and the one in which ’
his view of the Roman Church and his love 101 Italy are most eloquently *³

expressed. He regarded the return 01 the Pope to Rome as vital to its ¹

constitution, and 011 several occasions had written to Urban's predecessore f
on the subject (see infra, note, 1. 18). The Pope styled himself ‘ Pontifex
Romanae Ecclesiae ’‚ and must therefore in accordance with classical and- ’-

ecclesiastical tradition be at Rome. Just as in his letters to the Emperor
and in those about the relations 01 the Republics 01 Venice and Genoa he

overlooked practical consideratione, so here too he approaches the subiect
from an idealistic standpoint. He barely touches on the real difficulties ’
which the Pope had to face, and rather suggests that the main obstacle ’

was the private interests 01 the Cardinals established at Avignon.

Whatever effect this letter may have had upon Urban, he did actually ⁴ ,⁴

set-out 101 Italy in the following year, reaching Rome on the 16th October ⁵
1367. While there he repeatedly urged Petrarch to join him in Rome ¹

(see Sen. xi. 17). After three difficult years in Italy he was persuaded by ’'·

the F rench Cardinals to return to Avignon in September 1370. See P. Orsi,

Signorie e principati, pp. 135—41. For Petrarch’s view 01 the Papacy f
cf. Benetti-Brunelli‚ Le origini ital. della scuola umanistica, pp. 140-2, ff
156-65.
