When Petrarch died he was under the purptection of F rancesco da Carrara,
of Padua, and owing to the jealousy between him and Venice, Petrarch’s
intentions with regar‘d to his library ‘were not carried out. The books were
still in Padua in 1379, and were afterwards gattered. (See P. de Nolhac,
P. et l’humanisme, 1907, tom. i, ch. 2, p. 88 seq.)

PAGE 146. Moggio da Parma (b. 1325) was a schoolmaster at Verona, and
associated with Rinaldo Cavalchini da Villafranca. At Verona he became
friendly with Petrarch’s son Giovanni. From 1355 he was attached to the
family of Azzo da Correggio as secretary and tutor to Azzo's sons. He has
left a few Latin poems and letters. (See M. Vatasso, Del P. e di alcuni
suoi amici,‘pp. 67-105.) In 1354 Azzo (Fam. iv. 9), when governor of
, Verona, fell into disgrace with the Della Scala, because of his supposed
share in a conspiracy against Cangrande II della Scala. He died in Milan
in 1362. His wife was a Gonzaga, sister of Ugolino Gonzaga, whose death
is mentioned at the end of the letter. The latter was ,assassinated by his
twonbrothers. ί ’

Petrarch dedicated his book, De remediis utriusque fortunae, to Azzo,
though it was not finished until some years after his death.

PAGE 147. For an account of Leontius Pilatus, the Calabrian, and the
Latin translation of Homer, see Ο. Zenatti, Dante e F irenze, F lorence, 1902,
pp. 282-325, note. Petrarch first met Pilatus in the winter of 1358-9 at
Padua. De Nolhac thinks that Pilatus then translated Iliad ἰὴν for Petrarch,
but Zenatti has shown that he can only have translated a fragment at that
time. From 1360—2 Leontius was at Florence, living in Boccaccio’s house ς
during that period he made his translation of Homer, and was also giving
lectures in Greek. (See Boccaccio, De geneal. deor. gent., bk. xv, ch. 7.)
In 1363 he was back in Venice, and in the autumn of that year he returned
to Constantinople. An account of his death will be found in Sen. vi. 1.
With Petrarch's account of his character we may compare Boccaccio, De
geneal. deor.¹ gent., bk. xv, ch. 6 ‘ Aspectu horridus homo est, turpi facie,
barba prolixa, et capillitio nigro, et meditatione occupatus assidua, moribus
