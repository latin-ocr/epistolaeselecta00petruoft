Sen. xiii. 8 [8 June 1371]
PAGE 188. Pandolfo Malatesta, of Pesam, was yet another Italian prince

who delighted to honour Petrarch. Years before he had sent an artist to
paint his portrait. Possibly it was at that time, about 1348, that Petrarch

wrote the sonnet to Pandolfo‚ Rime civ. Again when he was a captain in '⁴

the service of the Visconti‚ he visited Petrarch at Milan, and had another
portrait painted.
In 1362 he married a second wife, Paola Orsini. On that occasion

Petrarch wrote Fam. xxii. 1, a treatise on marriage. He and his brother ’ ²

Ungaro succeeded to their father’s possessions of Rimini and Pesaro in

1364. In an article in the ‘ Zeitschrift fiir romanische Philologie ⁹, vol. xxxi >
(1907), Mascetta Caracci gives an account of the relations of Petrarch and *·

Pandolfo Malatesta 3 he puts the sonnet to Pandolfo as early as 1341. See
also F. Novati in P. e la Lombardia, pp. 45—7.
This letter was written from Arqua in the Euganean hills. The earliest*

reference to Arqua is in V ar. 46, dated 1360. See A. Zardo, Il P. e i Car· Α

rami, pp. 96-8. Petrarch had spent part of the summer of 1369 there,

and in June 1370 he acquired a house there. Except when he was driven ſs
back to Padua by the state of war between Venice and Padua‚ his last ³
years were spent in this villa, and there he died of sever on the 18th July ζ
1374. See A. Zardo, Di un errore tradizionale intorno alla morte di F. P. in -

46. unius anni: the first attack was in April 1370 at Ferrara, when he ⁷}

had started on his visit to Urban V at Rome. Cf. Sen. xi. 17.

Sen. xiii. 10 [4 January 1373]

PAGE 190. For Pandolfo Malatesta see the previous letter. The ‘loca -’

salubria ’ to which he invites Petrarch is Pesaro. Petrarch says in the letter
that he had been there in his youth, but we know nothing of the visit

In his later life Petrarch affected to be ashamed of his poems in Italian.
(As to the word nugellae, he applies that word to 3¹)ss his works, Latin and
Italian. Cf. Mascetta Caracci‚ Dedalo, pp. 80-2.) But although he seemed.
to despise everything which was not ⁴ classical ’, he was too much of an
artist not to realize the merits of the szonim, and never ceased to revise
his poems and to arrange them in a suitable order. In the Vatican Library
there is an autograph manuscript of the Canzoniere showing its last revision.
(Cf. V. Cian, Nugellae vulgares, Perugia‚ 1904.) Considering the subject-
matter of the Canzoniere, Petrarch’s pose may in part be due to the con-
ventional mediaeval attitude towards women. Cf. Comparetti, Virgilio

nel M. E. ii. 112.
