died in 1381. (Cf. Coluccio Salutati, Epistolario, ed. F. Novati, i, pp. 100,
2463 ii, p. 217.) The four letters to him are all about Cicero. Petrarch
met him in Florence in 1350, and -b-o-rrowed from him three of Cicero’s
speeches, the Pro Sulla, Pro Plancio, and Pro Lege Manilia. These appear
to have been sent on to him afterwards together with a fourth, the Pro
Milone, and in Fam. vii. 15 (April 1351), he thanks Lapo for the receipt of
the manuscripts. He also received a Quintilian from Lapo, and later sent
him a copy of the Pro Archia, which he had found at Liege in 1333 (cf. Sen.
xvi. 1). Since he has had the Cicero for four years, the date of the present
letter must be 1355. F racassetti Wrongly dates Fam. vii. 15, 1349, and the
present letter 1353. See A. F oresti, Per la storia del carteggio di F. P. con

in the service of the Grand Seneschal, Niccolo Acciaiuoli. The Emperor
Charles IV was now in Italy. In Fam. xix. 1 Petrarch writes to congratu-

invitation of the Emperor. In a letter to his friend Laelius, Fam. xix. 3,

PAGE 108. Petrarch here describes the death of the Doge Marin Faliero.
The sentence passed on that conspirator and its speedy execution seem to
have been jsss'tified. Faliero had been angered by the slight penalty inflicted
on a young nobleman who had insulted his wife, and together with a sea
captain, who had his own reasons for hating the government, plotted to
overthrow the aristocratic constitution. A sculptor, a relative of the sea
captain’s, was also in the plot. (See V. Lazzarini, F ilippo Calendario, Venice,
1894.) The plot was revealed by a nobleman on the 1 5th April. Faliero was
&eheaded on the 17th April. See F. C. Hodgson, Venice in the . . . F ourteenth
