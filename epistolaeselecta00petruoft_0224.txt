208 NOTES

59. sacrarum virginum 2 referring to the martyrdom of St. Ursula' and
the 1 1,000 virgins at Cologne. Their skulls are still exhibited there.

66. The present cathedral of Cologne was begun in 1248.

69. tribus saltibus ε the bones of the magi are said to have been brought
to Constantinople by Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great3 fr'om
there they were moved to Milan, and finally sent to Cologne by Frederick
Barbarossa.

75. Virg. Ecl. x. 47.
76. The Ardennes. In this year 1333 the Count of Flanders and the

Count of Brabant were at war over the town of Malines. Presumably this

is the war Petrarch is referring to.
91. fratrem tuum 1 his brother Giacomo had agreed to take Petrarch with

him to Rome. On the 22nd May of this year (1333) Stefanuccio‚ the son of -

Sciarra Colonna, had defeated the Orsini near S. Cesario. The feud between ’
the two houses was embittered by this victory, and for this reason Giacomo
had hastened to Rome to the assistance of his family.

The sonnet ‘ Vinse Annibal ’‚ Rime ciii, was written on the occasion of this

victory.
Fam. ii. 9 [21 December 1336]

’ PAGE 4. To Giacomo Colonna, Bishop of Lombez, one of the seven sons of>
Stefano Colonna. The Pope, J0hn XXII, had excommunicated the Emperor
Louis, the Bavarian, and while the latter was in Rome in 1328, Giacomo
Colonna read the bull of excommunication aloud and posted it up in the ·
city. As a reward for this act he was elected Bishop of Lombez in the
following year. Cf. also the letter to Giovanni Colonna on the death of his
brother, Fam. iv. 12. Giacomo had left Avignon suddenly in 1333 (cf. note,
1. 91, in the previous letter), while Petrarch was away on his Journey to
Paris and Germany, · therefore Petrarch says he had not seen him for four
years. (Petrarch uses the Roman inclusive method of reckoning.)

This 1s one of the few letters containing a reference to Laura. We know

from the prefatory letter to the Epist„ Fam„ that Petrarch burnt many of . ’

his letters when preparing them for publication 1n 1349 (Fracassetti dates
the prefatory letter 1359, but Mascetta-Caracci 1n his edition of the Can·
zonien, Lanciano, 1895, p. 70 seq.,has shown that the date was 1349), and
he may have intentionally destroyed those in which Laura‘s name occurred.
At any rate, we have very few letters written from Avignon between 1326
and 1337. Modern criticism seems to agree that she was an historical
person. For an account of an entry in Petrarch’s handwriting ifi‘h‘is copy
of virgil relating to her death see P. de Nolhac, Pe'trarque et l’humanisme,
Paris, 1907, tom. i, p. 140, &c., and an article by Monsignor A. Ratti (Pope
Pius XI) in Petrarca e la Lombardia, Milan, 1904, pp. 219-42.
