224 NOTES

Barbato see Fam. iv. 83 for Laelius, Fam. v.·1, note, l. 273 for Guido

Sette, Fam. xvii. 5 ; he was Archdeacon, afterwards Archbishop of Genoa
(Ianuensis).

24. coniugii is from the Colbert MS.

27. F rancesco Nelli (Simonides) (Fam. xiii. 3) and Boccaccio. Petrarch
first met them at Florence in the autumn of this same year 1350. The
present passage reads very like ‚a laterinterpolation.

’ 46. quem origo fecit alienigenam: Petrarch's pride in the superiority of .

Italy at this time is quite justifiable. Cf. his remarks about Richard of Bury
in Fam. iii. 1.

52. For the musician Aristoxenus see Cic. De Or. iii. 33. 132.

67-8. geminam . . . sedem z we have already seen that Petrarch had a house
ν at Parma 3 in a letter to Luca Cristiano (May 1349) he speaks of his house
at Padua. Apparently he shared a house there in common with the other
canons. See A. Zardo, Il P. e i Carraresi, Milan, 1887, p. 72.

Fam. ix. 3 [25 September 1351 ?]

PAGE 60. The date of this letter offers some difficulty. Its order among
the letters would suggest Petrarch's last years at Avignon, 1351 or 1352, as
its date. But the reference to the amica seems unlikely at so late a date.
We know from the Letter to Posterity that Petrarch dated a change ln his
life from his fortieth year3 he there says that from that time he gave up
the society of women? From another letter to Boccaccio (sen. viii. 1), we
gather that Petrarch considered his conversion complete in 1350. (On the
question of Petrarch’ s conversion see the note to Fam. x1.1.) No safe
conclusion can be drawn from Petrarch’ s use of the words senes and
senectuS, as we do not know what year he held to mark the beginning of
’ senectus, whether forty-five or fifty or another. In any case he rather
*z &ge-d senectus as the period when man was freed from 'the trials of the
³ flesh. Cf. Benetti-Brunelli, Le origini ital. della scuola umanisticaeg, p. 75.

Fam. x. 3 [25 September 1348]

PAGE 61. Gherardo was three years younger than Petrarch. The brothers
had been together at the University of Bologna, and afterwards had lived
together at Avignon. We have seen that Gherardo was Petrarch's com-
panion in the ascent of Mount Ventoux. After leading &jis-{of pleasure ιιι ,
his youth, as we gather from this letter, Gherardo became a converted ιιιαιι,ι
and in 1342 entered the Carthusian monastery of Montrieux near Marseilles,
where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1347 Petrarch paid a visit to
his brother at Montrieux, and as a result wrote his De otio Religiosorum.
He visited him again in April 1353, just before his final departure for Italy.

The first Eclogue of Petrarch’s Bucolics is addressed to Gherard0. In
