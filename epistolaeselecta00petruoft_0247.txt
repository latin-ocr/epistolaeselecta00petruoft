seq. supports Cola. V. Cian in ‘ Atti della R. Accad. delle scienze di Torino‚'
vol. xxviii, 1893, pp. 882-928‚ maintains that Petrarch first thought of
Cola, and later, after a revision of the poem, of a redeemer of Italy3
A. Bartoli in the Storia della lett. ital„ vol. vii (1884), ch. 4, pp. 113-24‚
suggests that the Canzone is addressed to Bosone da Gubbio‚ who was
Senator of Rome in 1337. Others have suggested Stefano Colonna the Elder‚
Stefano the Younger, and Paolo Annibaldi.

Petrarch's knowledge of Cola's character may have taught him that he
would be more likely to impress him by a story of a dream than by more
direct methods.

See F am.xiii. 6 for an account of Cola’s imprisonment and trial at Avignon.

Cola di Rienzo's seven months' reign ended on the 15th December 1347.
After various wanderings he went to Prague and gave himself up to the
'Emperor‚ Charles IV. In 1352 Charles sent him to the Pope at Avignon.
What followed is described in the present letter. He was finally liberated
in 1353 by the Pope, Innocent VI, who intended to make use of him in
restoring the papal power in Rome. (Cf. M. F aucon, Note sur la de'tention
de Rienzi ἁ Avignon‚ in ‘ Melanges d’archeol. et d’histoire . . . E⁷cole francaise
de Rome ', vii, 1887, pp. 53-8.) The reason Petrarch alleges for his release
is not found elsewhere. The story illustratos the change brought about by
the revival of learning. It was becoming fashionable and politic for princes
to admire or affect an admiration for poetry and literature. In a passage
omitted later in the letter Petrarch describes the uncritical respect of
ffirdinal for the name of poet.

Limoges. Cola had suffered imprisonment under the Emperor, a Bohemian,
and a Pope of Limoges.
