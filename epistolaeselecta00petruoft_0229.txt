seen that his friend Dionigi da-Borgo San Sepolcro was at the Court of
King Robert of Naples, and he may have influenced the King in Petrarch’s
favour. Petrarch went first to Naples before proceeding to Rome, and
submitted to a kind of examination before the King of his fitness to receive
the laurel crown. (See Petrarch’s own account in the Letter to Posterity,
and A. Hortis, La laurea del P., in ‘ Scritti inediti di F. P.’, Trieste, 1874,
pp· 1-55·)
Roberto de' Bardi, the Chancellor of the University of Paris from 1336,
was a Florentine, and a friend whose opinion Petrarch highly valued.
(Cf. the reference to him in the Metrical Epistle, ii. 18.) He died in 1349.
¹xAccording to F . Villani (Vite degli uom. illus. fiorentim) he left a number of
‘³‘ works in manuscript, none of which appear to have been printed.

This letter was written from Vaucluse (see note to Fam. viii. 3), fifteen
miles from Avignon. Cardinal Giovanni Colonna was noted for his out·
spoken attachment to Italy, so that Petrarch was probably well aware
what his advice would be.

PAGE 19. Written on the day of his leaving Vaucluse for Rome to receive
⁷ the laurel wreath. Petrarch had last seen Giacomo during his visit to Rome
in 1337. In 1340 the bishop returned to his see at Lombez in Gascony
(Vasconia), staying at Avignon only a short time. The occasion on which
Petrarch says he grudged Giacomo’s being in Rome without him was in 1333,
when on his return from Germany he found his friend had just left for Rome.

an essentia] part of his triumph. Robert also' retained his hereditary rights
as Count of Provence. For Robert see note to Fam. v. 1.

PAGE 21. Barbato of Sulmo was Chancellor of the Kingdom of Naples.
Petrarch had just met him at the Court of King Robert. He was a man of
literary tastes and an enthusiastic admirer of Petrarch’s Latin works.
Petrarch dedicated his Epistolae metricae to him. A few of Barbato’s
letters have been edited by M. Vatasso in studi e festi, Rome, 1904, no. 14.
Although he and Petrarch seldom met, their correspondence continued
until Barbato's death in 1363. For other letters to him see Fam. v. 1, 10,
vii. 1, xii. 7. Cf. N. Faraglia‚ B. di Sulmona, &c., in ‘Archivio storico
italiano’, ser. 5, tom. iii, 1889, p. 313 seq.
