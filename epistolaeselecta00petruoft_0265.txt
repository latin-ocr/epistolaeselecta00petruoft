Sen. v. 1 [14 December 1365]

PAGE 154. Ι11 1365 Boccaccio was sent by the city of F lorence on a diplo-
matic mission to the Pope, Urban V, at Avignon. (Cf. Hauvette, Boccace,
pp. 435-8.) It is to this journey that Petrarch here refers, when he re-
proaches him for not paying him a visit at Pavia.

In 1359 Galeazzo II Visconti had ,geacquired Pavia after the overthrow
of the gatriot Bussolari. (Cf. P. Orsi, Signorie e Principati, p. 1 18. Petrarch
had written a letter to Bussolari (Fam. xix. 19) at the request of Bernabo
visconti. See F. Novati, P. e i V isconti, in ‘ P. e la Lombardia ’, pp. 36-9,
59-61.) There had been a school at Pavia in Lombard days, and in 1361,
at Petrarch's suggestion, Galeazzo founded the University. In 1365 he
‚established his Court there partly owing to his suspicions of his brother
,vaernabfn and from 1363 Petrarch usually paid him a prolonged visit in the
’ autumn. (See V. Rossi, F. P. a Pavia, Pavia, 1904.)

Line 3. i. e. worse than the town commonly called Babylon.

33. Psalm xlv. 5 (xlvi. 4, Auth. Vers.).

43-4. A statue of Marcus Aurelius.

45. Boccaccio had many friends in Ravenna and was frequently there.
Some of his letters to Petrarch were written there.

56. Virg. Geo. iv. 3.

64. Guido Sette, Archbishop of Genoa. See Fam. xvii. 5.

72. amici communis ε Donato degli Albanzzmi, called by Petrarch Apen-
ninigena3 he is mentioned by name later in the letter. See Sen. xi. 2,
note, l. 59.

78. Philippe de Cabassoles was now Patriarch of Jerusalem. The De
Vita Solitaria was begun at Vaucluse in 1346.

107. Sen. v. 2, written in 1364. The other letter which he says he is
also sending, Sen. v. 3, is an attack on the medical profession, and the
book to which he refers the Invectivae contra medicum quemdam. (Cf. the
note to Fam. v. 19.)

119. Refers to that portion of the translation which he had requested
Boccaccio to send in Sen. iii. 6. This extract was not received until July
or August 1366, after Petrarch had sent off the De Vita Solitaria to Philippe
de Cabassoles in June 1366. From Sen. v. 4, to Donato, we know that the
present letter was not sent off until September 1366. So that this passage
about Homer must be an additi—033 made in July or August 1366. (Cf.
V. Rossi, Il codice latin0„8568‚ pp. 209-11.)
