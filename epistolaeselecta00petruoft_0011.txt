PREFACE

PETRARCH has been called the first modern man, and he
is the first man since the days of the Roman Empire who has
left us a detailed account of his own life and times. His letters
give us a complete picture of his career, and, in spite of the
fact that he wrote for publication, the sels-revelation is suffi-
ciently complete to make us feel that we know him in a way
that we know no other man of his age. Yet, perhaps because
of the wealth of detail, very different conclusions have been
, drawn as to the kind of man Petrarch was. An enormous

literature has grown up on the subject, and even to-day
critics are by no means agreed in their estimate of him.

The chief evidence for understanding the man Petrarch is
contained in his letter5‚ and the present selection has been
made with the intention of giving an account of his life in his
own words and of introducing descriptions of historical events
of which he was a spectator. It is hoped that the selection is
wide enough to allow the reader to form his own opinion as
to Petrarch's character. Shorter letters are generally given in
their entirety. The omissions in longer letters often consist
of illustrations from the Classics and the Latin FatherS, which
to us appear a pedantic display of learning. In this respect

it is unfair to judge Petrarch by modern standards3 such
passages at least serve to reveal the width and thoroughness of
his scholarship in an age when there were no indexes and few
books of reference. A brief summary of passages omitted has
been incorporated in the text. ’
Down to the year 1601 there were at least twelve printed
editions of the letters, From that date none, until Giuseppe
Fracassetti in 1859—62 published at Florence the text of the
