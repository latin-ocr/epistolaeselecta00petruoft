41. alio . . . volumine: the Epist. Sen.

Sen. i. 1 [1361]
PAGE 137. This prefatory letter was written in 1361, but was not sent, for in
Sen. i. 3 (June 1362) Petrarch announced to Nelli that he was dedicating
the collection of Epist. Sen. to him. (‘ Tu es enirn meus ille Simonides
quem prima huius operis compellat epistola, quae nondum tamen ad te
venit, nec veniet quidem sola.’) It is well known that Petrarch kept a copy‘s*
of most of the letters he wrote, for letter writing was a literary work with
him, and the example of Cicero inspired him to prepare collections of his
letters. A dedication of such a collection to a friend was natural, though
the dedicatory epistle need not have been sent.
Ι The Epist. Sen. contain the letters written between 1361 and Petrarch's
death, though, as has already been mentioned (Fam. xxiii. 19), several of
the Epist. Fam. are of a later date than 1361.

On the 10th July 1361 Petrarch’ s son died at Milan, a few days after
Petrarch had left Milan for Padua, and on the 8th August Petrarch heard
of Q-dgathsLSocrates at Avignon.

F rancesco Nelli in 1361 accepted the invitation of Niccolo Acciaiuoli and
became an official in his house.

Sen. i. 4 [1361 or 1362]

PAGE 138. C. Segre in Studi Petrarcheschi, pp. 199-224, has given reasons
for supposing that the Cardinal who accused Petrarch of being a magician
was Pierre Desprez, Bishop of Palestrina (born 1280, died September 1361).
The Cardinal held Virgil to have been a magician (cf. D. Comparetti, Virgilio
nel Medio Evo, Florence, 1896, vol. ii), an opinion which even Boceaccio
shared. Petrarch, being a student of Virgil, was also credited with necro-
mantic practices. When Stephen Aubert, who believed the charge against
Petrarch, became Pope Innocent V19Petrarch left Avignon in disgust.

Innocent died on the 12th September 1362, and this letter must have
been written before that date and after September 1361, when Cardinal
Desprez and Zanobi da strada died.

Line 47. Cardinal Giovanni Colonna.

75—81. The office of Papal Secretary became vacant by the death of Zanobi
da Strada in September 1361. Petrarch again refused the offer of that
post. Of his two fellow- townsmen whom he recommends, the one who was
ready to accept was Francesco Nelli, the other Boceaccio. (See G. Traver-
sari, Per l’autenticitd dell' epistola del Boccaccio a F. Nelli, in ‘Giorn. stor.
