Pandolfo’s brother, Ungaro, died at Rimini in July 1372. His second
wife, Paola Orsini, had died in February 1371, and he himself lived only
afew months after the date of this letter.

There is another version of this letter (V ar. 9), which is probably the
unrevised version as actually sent. Cf. the note to V ar. 43, p. 246. In
V ar. 9 in speaking of Ungaro he calls him ⁴ domini mei ’. The ‘ dominus ’
has dropped out in this revised version. Also the words ‘coluit' and
‘ obsequiis ’ do not occur in V ar. 9. We may infer that Petrarch’s familiarity 2
with princes was not quite so close as appears from the edited letters.

Line 33. vulgares iuveniles: perhaps one of these adjectives is a gloss
which has crept into the textg ο *zu-J

43. In the introductory letter to Theodosius.

44. scriptorum raritas: for Petrarch’ s troubles with copyists cf. Sen. v.

1, l. 91, seq.
Sen. xiii. 12 [1372]

Pace 192. The scholars of the Renaissance are notorious for their powers
of invective3 in this respect also Petrarch was their forerunner. This is
characteristic of his controversial writings rather than of his letters. The
Cardinal who irritated Petrarch to the outburst in this letter is thought
to have been Guy de Montfort‚ Bishop of Porto, formerly his friend (see
Fam. xvi. 1). Possibly Petrarch's part in persuading Urban V to return
to Rome had caused the loss of the Cardinal’s favour. It is worthy of
note that jean de Hesdin, against whom Petrarch wrote (about 1367) his
Apologia contra cuiusdam anonymi Galli calumnias, was attached to the
Cardinal’s household. See P. de Numae, P. et l’humanisme‚ 1907, tom. ii,

· exc. 9. The Pope of whom the incident of this letter is related was Gre-

gory XI, who succeeded Urban V at the end of 1370. Petrarch seems to
have had hopes of obtaining some benefice-from him. The next letter to
Bruni shows how disappointed he was that nothing had come of these
hopes. There is practically no evidence as to the values of the benefices
he was already holding.

Line 3. locus alter dabitur. One of the many passages which make it
clear that Petrarch was in the habit of writing letters of business, possibly
in Italian, together with ‘ full dress ’ epistles (cf. Fam. xvi. 2).

Sen. xv. 7 [7 january 1374 ?]
Pam: 194. Luigi Marsili was a Florentiae and an Augustinian friar. He
had studied at the University of Pan‘s. He was a classica} scholar and an
outspokengdtic of the Church. His philosophical opinions were much in-
flue‘nced by Petrarch. Aftef‘Petrarch's death he wrote a commentary on
some of his Italian poems. Petrarch here presents him with a manuscript
