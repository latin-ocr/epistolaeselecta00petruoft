PAGE 103. Petrarch made several attempts in the course of his life to
learn Greek, but fortune ’was always against him, and he never succeeded.
The Calabrian Barlaam‚ to whom he refers m this letter, was a Basilian monk
who came to Avignon 111 1339 on a mission from the Eastern Emperor to
the Pope. Petrarch met him then and again in 1342, but his attempt to
learn Greek from him was frustrated by his own efforts, as it was through
his influence that Barlaam was made Bishop of Gerace, and left Avignon
in October 1342 for his see in Calabria. Cf. F. Lo Pareo, P. e Barlaam‚
Reggio di Calabria, 1905. 111 1353 Petrarch met Nicholas Sigerus, a Greek
petor, and the result of that meeting was a present of a manuscript of
Homer. For the story of Leontius Pilatus, another Calabrian, and the
Latin translation of Homer which he made, see Sen. iii. 6.

Line 13. Macrobius, Somn. Scip. ii. 10. 1 1. Fracassetti reads ‘ Ambrosius
et Macrobius ’. This is clearly a mistake, as the words following show that
Petrarch is referring to one author. Macrobius was also called Ambrosius.
The Basle edition of 1581 is correct here.

27-9. Hor. Ars Poet. 145.

60-1. Plato philosophorum princeps: Petrarch, in his reaction against
mediaeval scholasticism, extolled Plato’s philosophy, but his knowledge of
Platonism came to him for the most part indirectly through the Latius.

(Cf. G. Gentile, La F ilosofia, in ‘ Storia dei generi letterarii ⁹, pp. 178-81, y

188—92. ) The manuscript of Plato to which he here refers he had acquired
in France some years before. He also had a Latin translation of the
Timaeus. Cf. P. de Nolhac,P. etl‘ humanisme, 1907, tom. ii ,.ΡΡ 127-88, for
Petrarch’ s study of Greek authors.

68. in sermone patrio: there were summaries of Homer 111 Latin, e-g.
the Periochae attributed to Ausonius, and an abridgement known as
‘ Pindarus Thebanus ’.
