57. mea impensa: i. e. Petrarch wished to pay the expense of a copy
of the translation for himself. It has been supposed that Petrarchunder·
took the expense of the whole affair. A full discussionof the credit due
respectively to Boccaccio and to Petrarch for this first translation of Homer
will be found in Zenatti, op. cit. Zenatti gives the entire credit to Boccaccio,
who procured the manuscript which Leontius used, kept him in his house for ’ ’
more than two years, and himself assisted in the work of the translation. Cf.
also Hauvette, Boccace, p. 367, and the passage in Sen. xvi. 1 (note‚l. 133).
