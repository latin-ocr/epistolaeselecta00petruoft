della scuola umanistica, p. 179 seq. The present letter is the third of some
thirty letters addressed to Boccaccio. The other letters given in this se-
lection will show the course of their unbroken friendship down to Petrarch's
death. Boccaccio’s letters have been edited by F. Corazzini‚ Florence, 1877.

Petrarch was now on his way back to Vaucluse after spending the last
four years in Italy. Among the friends who detained him at Verona were
Mastino ΙΙ della Scala, lord of that town, Azzo da Correggio, who had
returned into the favour of the Della Scala family and was now at their
Court, having sold, Parma to the Este family in 1344, and Guglielmo da
Pastrengo (seeY'bm. iv. 9).

Florence in 1350. Fracassetti suggests that Bruno Casini may be one of
the four, but he died in 1348 of the plague.

see F . C. Hodgson, Venice in the ‘Thirteenth and F ourteenth Centuries, London,
1910, ch. xv, and P. Orsi, Signorie e principati, p. 89 seq. The question of
the state of war between Venice and Genoa was one which moved Petrarch
deeply as an Italian. He writes to the Doge of Genoa and again to Dandolo
on this subject. He nowhere discusses the real causes of the quarrel between
the two republicS, but appeals to them on Qgher ground than that of their
immediate interests. (For his diagnosis of the troubles of Italy in his day
see Benetti-Brunelli‚ Le origini ital. d. scuola uman„ p. 124 seq. Cf. also
