Fam. i. 4 [9 August Ι333]

ΡΑσΕ 1. Giovanni Colonna was the second son of Stefano, the head of the
house of Colonna at this time. Petrarch was on a footing of intimate
friendship with several members of this family. There are sixteen letters
addressed to Giovanni, as well as several metrical epistles and the sonnet,
Rime cclxvi. In Sen. xvi. 1 Petrarch gives an account of his friendship
with the younger brother Giacom03 while both were students at the
University of Bologna they had* been attracted to one another, but it wasnot

until after Petrarch’s return to Avignon in April 1326 that they became
friends. (F. Lo Pareo has tried to show in Errori . . . nella biogr. del P„

⁴ Giorn. stor. d. lett. ital.', xlviii, 1906, pp. 37-69, that Petrarch returned to
Avignon at the end of 1325, and as a result puts back by a year the date of a
number of the earlier letters. But the case against the traditional date, 1326,

is not proved. See also P. de Nolhac, P. ἀ Bologne au temps d'Azzo V isconti, '

in ‘ P. e la Lombardia’, Milan, 1904, pp. 87-93.) Giacomo, now Bishop of
’ Lombez, took Petrarch with him to his see in Gascony (on this journey see
F. Lo Pareo, Il P. e Giacomo Colonna a Tolosa, in ‘ Mem. d. R. Accad. di
archeol. . . . in Napoli’, 1911, pt. 2, p. 229 seq.), and on their return
to Avignon in 1330 introduced him to his brother the Cardinal. From
1330-7 Petrarch was living in the Cardinal's house at Avignon, and was
probably to some extent dependent on him. It was not until 1335 that he
received his first Church preferment, a canonry at Lombez. The Cardinal
probably paid the expenses of the journey which this letter describes, and
we shall hear of Petrarch's securing his consent for his visit to Rome in

1337. Giovanni was created a cardinal by Pope John XXII in 1327 before ·

he had reached the age of thirty. For other details of Petrarch’s relations
with the family see Fam. iv. 6, v. 3, and viii. 1.
