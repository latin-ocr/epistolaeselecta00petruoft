NOTES 251

Line 5. Philippe de Cabassolles‚ formerly Bishop of Cavaillon (Fam. v. 3 -
note, l. 67).

18. praedecessoribus tuis duobus ε in his metrical epistles to Benedict XII
(i. 2) and Clement VI (ii. 3). With the Pope’s immediate predecessor,
Innocent VI, he had not been on such intimate terms. Innocent had for
long believed Petrarch to be a magician (see Sen. i. 4). ’

19. Romano Imperatori: Charles IV (see Fam. xxi. 1).

48. Bononiense Studium ι the Pope had made arrangements for the
protection and support of students at the University.

71. altero lumine: cf. Dante, Monarchia, iii. 4 and 16, and Purg. xvi.
106, 107 ‘ Soleva Roma, che il buon mondo feo, Due soli aver '. This com-
parison, common in the Middle Ages, appears to originate with Gregory VII.
See R. W. and J. A. Carlyle, A History of Med. Political Theory, Edinburgh,
1903, &c., vol. iii, pp. 94, 95.

1 18—20. Lamentations i. 1. Cf. Dante, Purg. vi. ,ι 12, 1 13 ‘ Vieni a
veder la tua Roma che piagne, Vedova e sola, e di e notte chiama'. Petrarch

, must have had this passage in mind as he copied out from Lamentations

the last words‘ princeps provinciarum facta est sub tributa', which are the
source of Purg. vi. 78‘ Non donna di provincie, ma bordello’. Cf. also
Vita Nuov. xxviii. 1 3 xxi. 1 3 Epistole xi. 1 (Opere, Florence, 1919), which
refer to the same text of Lamentations. ⁴

134. V ulsinii lacus anguillae z cf. Dante, Purg. xxiv. 23, 24 ‘ Dal Torso
fu, e purga per digiuno L'anguille di Bolsena e la vernaccia’, of another
Pope, Martin IV. Again this seems like a recollection.

141. Cf. what was said of Cardinal Giovanni Colonna’s Italian sympathies

in the note to Fam. iv. 4.

158. Cardinal Guy de Montfort, Bishop of Porto. See Fam. xvi. 1 and
Sen. xiii. 12.

193. praedonum molestias: among the reasons which induced Urban to
leave Avignon were the indignities which the Papal Court had suffered at the
hands of the ‘ compagnie di ventura ' (see Fam. xix. 9, note tol. 24), notably
from the company of Bertrand Du Guesclin, when on his way to the war in
Castile in 1365. Du Guesclin had held the Court up to ransom. Petrarch has
referred to this incident in the passage omitted above.

226. Esse, ubi desunt maria, Alpes ε cf. Rime cxxviii. 33—5 :

Ben provvide natura al nostro stato
Quando dell’ Alpi schermo

“ Pose fra noi e la tedesca rabbia.

251. Virg. Geo. ii. 109.
Sen. viii. 5 [9 June 1367]
