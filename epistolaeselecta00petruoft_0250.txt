234 NOTES

Fam. xvi. 2 [1352]

PAGE 94. Petrarch heard the story here related of his brother before he
left Italyin May 1351. Ildebrando de’ Conti, the Bishop of Padua, a friend
to whom one metrical epistle (iii. 25) and possibly two of the Epist. sine
Tit. (nos. 8 and 14, cf. p. 220) are addressed, died on the znd November
1352. (In Fam. xv. 14 Petrarch writes to the clergy of Padua on their
loss.) We may suppose that an earlier letter to Gherardo has not been
preserved, and that the present letter is a literary effort q‘rilgig occasion

c < ξ’ of the death of Ildebrando. For other similar literary epistles see Fam.
'‘⁸7⁷3xv111 7, ΧΧ. 2, and Sen. xiii. 12 (see note).
For details about the monastery at Montrieux and the various members

of Gherardo's order mentioned 1n this letter, see H. Cochin, Le Fre’re de
Pe'trarque, p. 76.

Line 6. litoribus: the Colbert MS. reads ‘liguribus ’.

42. iuxta: the Colbert MS. reads ‘ busta '. But V. Rossi, in the ‘ Me-
morie ’ of the ‘ Accad. dei Lince'i ’, Rome, 1920, vol. xvi, fasc. 5, p. 191,
suggests that the correct reading is ‘iusta ’.

Fam. xvi. grand-„135 [October 1353]

> PAGE 97. When Petrarch left Vaucluse for the last time in May 1353, he

was undecided where to settle. There were many choices before him and
many cities where he would have been welcomed. When his Florentine
friends heard that he had settled at Milan, several of them, including
Boccaccio, wrote to remonstrate with him. (It should be noted that
Francesco Nelli, to whom Petrarch is now writing, did not blame him. See
his letter to Petrarch in Cochin, Un ami de P., p. 192.) Petrarch himself
in 1351 had severely criticized the Archbishop Giovanni Visconti, as we
gather· from Boccaccio's letter, Ut huic epistolae (Corazzini, pp. 47—52), and

 

 

again in Fam. xx. 1, on the relations of the Visconti with Pisa. Petrarch’ s ἓ

biographers have generally regarded his life at Milan as a blot on his career.
The Visconti were certainly tyrants, unscrupulous and cruel, but 1t may be
doubted whether they were worse than their contemporaries. They were
more hated because they were more successful, especially by the F lorentines,
whose opinion of them can hardly be regarded as unprejudiced. It must
be remembered that Petrarch had no theoretica] objections to despotism3'
he regarded the courts of princes as the proper home of humanism. (Cf.
Benetti-Brunelli, Le origini ital. d. scuola umanistica, pp. 181, 182.) Both
the Archbishop Giovanni Visconti and his nephew Galeazzo were patrone
of learning, and Petrarch probably felt that he could carry on the work of
his life in all honour under their protection. See A. Hortis, Il P. e i V isconn',
in ⁴ Scritti inediti di F. P.’‚ pp. 62-74‚ and especially F.'Novati‚ P. e i
Visconti, in ‘ P. e la Lombardia ⁹, pp. 21-30.
