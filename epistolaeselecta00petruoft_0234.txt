Fam. v. 10 [25 February 1345]

After his journey to Naples in 1343, Petrarch proceeded to Parma to his
friend Azzo da Correggio, and left there in the manner here described in
February 1345. We have seen that Azzo had ,ἱρά Parma to Obizzo d'Este
(Fam. iv. 9, note). The Visconti, who wished to punish Azzo’s treachery,
the Gonzagas, who were jealous of Obizzo d’Este, and Mastino della Scala,
who had supported Obizzo and was now angered at his bad saith, had formed
an alliance and besieged Parma in 1344. Cf. Petrarch’s words, ‘ prope totius
Italiae motibus . . . coarctamur’.

According to the majority of critics it was during this visit to Parma that
Petrarch wrote the Canzone ‘ Italia mia ’. (But C. Steiner, La sede nell' impero
. . . nel P.‚ in the ‘ Giorn. Dantesc0‚’ xiv, 1906, pp. 8-55‚ upholds the date
1354 at Milan, whilst F. Torraca, in ‘ Atti ’ of the ‘ R. Accad. di archeologia
di Napoli ', vi, 1918, pp. 349-64, maintains that it was written in 1341.)

Line 5. ad pugnam is restored from the Venice and Basle edition.

Line 26. Rhegium: Reggio in Emilia.

32-3. Virg. Aen. iv. 123.

83. In the letter Petrarch speaks of ‘ multis iam diebus interiectis ' (l. 41),
but this date allows only two days from the day of leaving Parma.

Fam. v. 19 [13 March 1352]
PAGE 3⁷. The Pope, Clement VI, had shown considerable favour to

. ι Petrarch. He bestowed several Church preferments upon him, and offered

,” him the post of papal secretary. But it was during his tenure of the papacy
that the abuses of the Court at Avignon were at their worst. Many of the
Epistulae sine Titulo, outspoken denunciations of the ‘ Western Babylon ',
were written in Clement’s time.

The present letter was written during the Pope's last illness, and involved
Petrarch in a dispute with one of the court physicians, cuhninating in a tract
entitled Invectivae contra medicum quemdam. We shall -see other examples
in the letters of his animosity against the medical profession. He accused
the doctors of being unscientific, of paying no regard to the constitution of
the individual patient. He believed that he understood his own constitution
better than any doctor could. In two long letters to the distinguished
physician Giovanni Dondi of Padua (Sen. xii. 1 and 2), the tone of which is
most friendly, he rejects Dondi’s advice about his own health, except in* so
far as he had already found it suitable to his constitution. He had an
optimistic view of nature as a guide (cf. Benetti·Brunelli‚ Le origini italiane
della scuola umanistica‚ Milan, 1919, p. 96 and p. 230 seq.). The letter
was written after Petrarch had made some stay at padua, where there had
long been a medical and scientific school, which accepted a materialistic
