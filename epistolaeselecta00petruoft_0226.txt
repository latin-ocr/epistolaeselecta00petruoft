24-7. The disturbed state of the country here described was due to the
absence of the Pope and the resulting anarchy in Rome and the papal
territory. A number of small local tyrants had sprung up, who were
generally at war with one another and who did not consider open brigandage
beneath their dignity. The feud between the two principal families of the
Roman aristocracy, the Colonna and the Orsini, was not the least cause of
the anarchy. Hallam, in his V iew os the State of Europe during the M iddle
Ages, 1869, p. 189, says: ‘ nor was the downfall of the Western Empire
so fatal to its capital as the contemptible feuds of the Orsini and Colonna
families ’. Cf. Gregorovius,History of Rome in the Middle Ages, London,
1900, &c., vol. vi, ch. 4, and P. Orsi, Signorie e principati, in the ‘ storia pol.
d’ Italia ', Milan, [1904], pp. 77, 78.

PAGE 10. Tommaso Caloria da Messina was a poet who had been at the
University of Bologna with Petrarch. Many of the early letters are addressed
to him, and in the old editions many wrongly so addressed (see the note to
Fam. iii. 10). He is mentioned in the ‘Trionso d'Amore, iii. 59. See G. Bor·
ghese, Il P. e T. da Messina, in ‘ Archiv. Storico Messinese ’, vol. vi, 1905.
He died in 1341.

Richard of Bury was in Avignon in 1331 and again in 1333 on diplomatic
affairs. He had been tutor to Edward ΙΙΙ of England‚ and when that
prince succeeded to the throne he held various offices of trust under the
Crown. He was well known as a lover of learning, and is the author of
Philobiblon (see C. Segre, studi Petrarcheschi, p. 225 seq.). The date of this
letter is uncertain. Petrarch says he is writing ‘ ex ipsis Britannici Oceani
littoribus ⁹. Fracassetti assumes that he made a Journey to the north after
his return from Rome in 1337, and assigns the letter to that year. F. Lo
Pareo in studi dedicati a F. Torraca, Naples, 1912, p. 87, seq., also insists on
this journey3 he thinks the present letter was written, not to Tommaso
da Messina, but to Agapito, grandson of Sciarra Colonna, who came to
Avignon in 1330, with the elder Stefano. The other letters to Agapito were
written from Vaucluse, i. e. after August 1337. This argument is very
plausible apart from the question of the date. Petrarch nowhere explicitly
refers to such a journey in 1 3 37, and his silence on the subject in his letter to
Posterity is the strongest evidence against it 3 it seems safer to conclude that
the only occasion on which he can have been on the shores of the British
ocean was during his journey in 1333. G. Koerting, in Petrarca’s Lebm
