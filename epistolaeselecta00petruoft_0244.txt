PAGE 74. A large number of Petrarch’s letters are addressed to reigning‘
princes and popes on political subjects. The exceptional position which he

held as the first man of letters of his day allowed him to address them with
surprising freedom. In his ideal state the men of letters were to be the

a Α Δ ‹ ι counsellors of princes (cf. Benetti-Brunelli, Le origini ital. d. scuola amani-

stica, pp. 107, 108). But he was scarcely taken seriously as a politician.
He was not successful as a diplomatist, and we shall find that the Visconti⁸
employed him on missions of a ceremonial nature rather than on diplo-
matic questions. (But see F. Novati, P. e i V immi, in ‘ P. e la Lombardia ⁹,
ffpp. 21-30.) His letters Q 213?lewa in practical politica,¹ μή
he adopted an „igealistic standpoint and disregarded the difficulties which
confronted the politician. ν

His reverence for Roman civilization led him to adopt an idealistic view
of Rome as the* centre of the universe. The continuity of the Roman
Empire resided in the Roman people‚ and therefore the Emperor’s seat
must be at Rome. Petrarch was an Italian rather than an Imperialist.
—Hence he could without inconsistency dream of Robert of Naples as the
saviour of Italy, champion Cola di Rienzo‚ serveffitheyiscssQgQ and invite
the Emperor into Italy. As a critic he was able to expose the forgeries
supporting the Austrian claim to a right of succession from the Roman
Emperors (Sen. xvi. 5). Cf. Benetti-Brunelli‚ op. cit.‚ pp. 140-53, for his
view of the Empire. Also Β. Zumbini, studi sul P., Florence‚ 1895, p. 161

His first letter to Charles IV was written in February 1351. (Fam. x. 1. ’ “
Fracassetti gives the date as 13 50, but see K. Palm, Italieniscbe Ereignisse
in den ersten Jahrz'n Karls IV, Gottingen, 1873, p. 58.) The growing power
and aggressiveness of the Archbishop Giovanni Visconti at Milan had led
to an intrigue on the part ofolorence and other Tuscan cities to bring the
Emperor to Italy. Charles him'self was not an enthusiast for the Empire,

was mainly interested in his own kingdom of Bohemia‚ and his journey to
