xiii. 3 Petrarch writes to his friend Guglielmo da Pastrengo, asking him to

son were most unhappy 3 there are several letters from Petrarch (cf. espe-
cially Fam. xix. 16) complaining of the son’s conduct, and finally one of deep
regret (Sen. i. 3) when Giovanni had died of the plague on the loth July 1361.

very frequent in Petrarch. The remark about the belated traveller above
is such a recollection. Cf. an article by A. Hortis in ‘ Archeographo Trie-

PAGE 80. Cola di Rienzo was in Avignon in 1343 in connexion with a deputa-
tion to the Pope from the City of Rome (he was not a member of the deputa·
tion, see C. Cipolla, F. P. e le sue relazioni colla Corte Avignonese, etc., p. 14),
and during that visit Petrarch made his acquaintance. Petrarch’s first letter
to Cola was written shortly afterwards, and relates to, conversations they

had had about Rome. The two men were alike in their reverence for Rome j

and antiquity, and when in May 1347 Cola effected his revolution in Rome, ξ
Petrarch was enthusiasticin his support. He addressed a letter of encourage· ⁸

ment to him and another to the Roman people. In the present letter he
Ι claims that his championship of Rienzo had brought him unpopularity. In :

his letters to the Tribune he used most bitter language about the Roman - 5
nobles, in particular the Colonna‚ and it is not surprising that his intimacy

with Cardinal Giovanni began to wane. In November Petrarch left for Italy, ’

partly with the intention of being nearer to Cola. (C. Cipolla, Sui motiva· de'l
ritorno di F. P. in Italia nel 1347, in ‘ Giorn. stor. d. lett. ital.’, xlvii, pp.
253—65, has shown that Petrarch was also entrusted with a mission by the

Pope to dissuade Mastino della Scala of Verona from helping King Louis of s

Hungary ιη his' 1nvasion of Naples. ) On his way he heard that Cola’ s power

was declining, he addressed a warning letter to him, but before Petrarch ’ἱ

carried out his purpose of proceeding to Rome, Cola had {alleg-on the
15th December. Petrarch had reached Genoa by the 25th November.. ’
