in 1349 he affects to be aviamed of his poems in the. vernacular. On this
passage we may mention that Petrarch’s son Giovanni (Fam. xiii. 2) was
bomin 1337, and his daughter Francesca in 1343. Cf. also Fam. ix. 3.

98. Petrarch planted laurels in all his gardens, partly no doubt because
of their association with Laura. Cf. Petrarch's Eclogue 10, on the fall of
a laurel. He had gardens at several successive houses, at Parma, Milan,
Padua, and finally Arqua in the Euganean hills. For Petrarch as a gardener
see P. de Nolhac, P. et l’humanisme‚ 1907, tom. ii, excursus 2.

99. The Durance, which flows into the Rhone a few miles south of the
Sorgues. The Colbert MS. reads ‘ Ruenciam ’.

 

Fam. viii. 7 [23 May 1349]

Paci: 52. Petrarch became acquainted with Louis Sanctus of Beeringen
(Socrates) when he was at Lombez in 1330 with the bishop, Giacomo
Colonna. Of all his friends Petrarch seems to have been most attached
to Socrates. He dedicated the Epist. Fam. to him. He never succeeded
in persuading him to live with him in Ital'y. After the death of Giovanni
Colonna Socrates remained in Avignon until his death in May 1361. What
q 'exactly his position there was is not known, but some details about
his Church preferments have been ’collected by Berliere in Un ami de Ρ.,
Louis Sanctus de B., Rome, 1905. In the Trionjo d’ Amore, iii. 67-81, there is
a passage ii1 his honour, where his name is united with that of Laelius. The
following letter gives all the information we have as to Socrates’ origin.

The present letter reveals the deep impression made upon Petrarch by the
disaster of the great plague in 1348, the same plague which provided the
setting for Boccaccio’s Decameron. In various letters he mentions the many
friends he lost in that and the following year, but the fact that kaura also
died of the plague is not resssslfedssss in the letters.

Line 52. Petrarch met Paganino Besozzi of Milan in December 1347 at
Parma, where he was Podesta, and where he died on the 23rd May 1349.
The date is given in an autograph entry by Petrarch on his manuscript
of virgil (see articles by Monsignor A. Ratti (Pope Pius XI) in P. e la Lom-
bardia‚ p. 228, and by F. Novati, pp. 14-19).

PAGE 58. This letter tells us who Socrates was. The reference to the
· death of Mainardo and Petrarch's anxiety about the fate of Luca cristiano
fix the date at 1350. ο
