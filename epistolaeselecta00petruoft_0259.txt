NOTES 243

probably 13 53 (F. Wulff, Pre‘occupations- de Ρ., in the ‘ Acta Universitatis

· Lundensis ’‚ Afd. 1, Bd. 2, nr. 4, 1906, argues that this happened at Christrnas

1356. But his argument seems to be unsound. Cf. Mascetta Caracci‚
Dedalo, p. 363, note), soon after he had left for Italy. Cf. Sen. x. 2.
Among the books rescued was the manuscript of Plato in Greek, to which
he refers later in the letter. (Cf. Fam. xviii. 2, note, l. 60—1.)

40. Boccaccio visited Petrarch at Milan in March 1359. Cf. Fam. xx. 7.

47. Petrarch held a ganonry at Padua and generally spent Easter there,
while his home was still at Milan. (See Fam. xi. 3.)

60. In a letter to Nero Morandi (Fam. xxi. 10) Petrarch gives an account
of this accident.

76. This manuscript of Homer for sale at Padua was bought by Boccaccio
and used by Pilatus for his translation. At any rate Petrarch’s manuscript
was not sent. For Pilatus and this translation see the note to Sen. iii. 6.

90. Hor. Ars Poet. 141, 142. The modern editions make no mention
of the tradition that this is part of a translation by Cicero.

. 113. Pilatus made a translation of a fragment of the Iliad for Petrarch
when they first met in Padua in the winter of 1358-9. See the note to
Sen. iii. 6.

Fam. xxiii. 8 [18 July 1361]
PAGE 128. Petrarch left Milan at the beginning of July, just before the
death of his son Giovanni‚ which happened at Milan on the 10th July 1361.
But from this letter we see that he still considered himself in the service

of the Visconti. Charles IV evidently thought it worth while to retain
Petrarch's good opinion. Petrarch was certainly not unsusceptible to the

flattery of the great, but he must have realized by now what Charles’ ’

’ policy was. The Emperor’s visit to Qermanfin 1368 seems to have left
little impression on him. On Petrarch's meeting with Charles on that
occasion see L. Zanutto‚ Carlo IV . . . e F. P. a Udine nel 1368,
Udine, 1904. The latest letter addressed to Charles was written in 1363
(Fam. xxiii. 15). In the spring of 1362, after a further invitation from the
Emperor, Petrarch actually sletv'ut’ on his journey to Germany. He had

¹ already in the same year started on a journey to Avignon, but on both

occasions he had had to turn back owing to the unsettled state of the
country, and finally went to Venice in October. The Visconti were at war
with Bologna‚ and with Cardinal d'Albornoz commanding the forces of the
Church and her allies‚ Nicolas II d’Este‚ Cansignorio della Scala, Francesco
da Carrara, and the Gonzaga. They were also at war in Piedmont against
the Marquis of Montferrat and his ally the Marquis of Saluzzo.

Line 4. A combination of two Virgilian phrases. Cf. Aen. ii. 765 and v. 267.

47. Galeazzo II Visconti.
