Johannes de Conversano und Johannes Malpaghim', in ‘ Beitrage zur Gesch·

There are two letters to Donato degli Albanzani on the occasion of his

first leaving Petrarch (Sen. v. 5 and 6), and another letter of recommendation

to Francesco Bruni written at the same time as the present letter (Sen. xi. 8).

PAGE 183. After his arrival at Rome in 1367 Urban V repeatedly tried to
persuade Petrarch, through his friend Philippe de Cabassoles and by his own
letters, to join him in Rome. After many excuses·(Sen. xi. 1 and 12),
Petrarch had promised to attempt the journey in the' spring of 1370 (Sen.
xi. 16). In the present letter he relates how he was overtaken by illness and
had to return to Padua.

Line 38. Niccold II d’Este was lord of Ferrara at this time. He and his

⁵ brother Ugo did all they could for Petrarch, as he tells us in a letter written
to Niccolo in this same year on the occasion of the death of Ugo (Sen. xiii. 1).

52. On many occasions during his life the report of Petrarch’s death
was spread abroad, as he relates in several letters. The first occasion was
during (according to Sen. iii. 7) his journey to Naples in 1343, and Antonio
de’ Beccari wrote a canzone on his death, to which Petrarch replied with
the sonnet, Rime cxx (perhaps the date should be 1341, as Petrarch was ill
in that year (Fam. iv. 2), and no illness of his is recorded in 1343). The
particular instance to which the present passage refers was in 1365, when
the Pope, who intended to give Petrarch a canonry at Carpentras, was
prevented by news of his death. For an account of Petrarch’s health see
the chapter in Mascetta Caracci, Dedalo, p. 463 seq., where the question of
Petrarch's being an epilepticis discussed, and cf. Lo Parco, La leggenda della
morte del P.‚ in ‘ Rivista bibliogr. d. lett. ital.’, xvi, p. 71 seq.

Modena in favour of Luca Cristiano. .

VXar broke out in December 1371 between Venice and Da Carrara,
Petrarch’s patron. (See Hodgson, Venice in the. . . F ourteenth Century, p. 497
seq.) Owing to the war Petrarch had to leave his villa at Arqua (see Sen.
xiii. 8) in the Euganean hills and live in Padua. At its conclusion in Sep-
tember 1373, he accompanied F rancesco Novell0‚ Da Carrara‘s son, to

Venice to accept the Venetian terms of peace. (See V. Lazzarini, La seconda
ambasceria di F. P. a V enezia, in ‘ Miscellanea Mazzoni ⁹, Florence, 1907,

vol. i, pp. 1-73.)
