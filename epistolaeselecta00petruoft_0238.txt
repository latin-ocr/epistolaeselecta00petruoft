222 NOTES

There has been much confusion as to the identity of Olympius. Fracassetti
supposes he was Mainardo, although he has to assume that the Olympius of
Fam. xi. 12, written in July 13 51 was another unknown friend to whom
Petrarch had given the same nickname. In the Colbert MS. of the letters
at Paris, the text of Fam. viii. 7 (given by H. Cochin in the article in F.
Petrarca e la Lombardia, op. cit., pp. 133-75) varies considerably from
Fracassetti’s text, and there it is clear that Luca was Olympius and that
Mainardo’s nickname was Simplicianus. A manuscript in the British
Museum (Add. MS. 22814) has the same reading. From the characters
which Petrarch draws of his two friends in Fam. viii. 7 it is much more likely

that the letters addressed to Olympius, full of erudition as they are, should ,

have been meant for Luca, rather than for the simple gentleman Mainardo.

It was in 1337 that Petrarch retired to his lonely farm at Vaucluse at the
rising of the Sorgues, to the great surprise of his friends, who failed to
understand his love for the country. In a letter to Guido Sette (Sen. x. 2)
he relates how he had felt an attraction for the place in his hoyhood.
Vaucluse may be said to form the background of many of the poem83 in

the present letter we are told how many of his Latin works were written or ·

begun during his solitary life there. He was yet to spend several years there,
leaving it finally in 1353. See E. Miintz‚ La casa del P. a V alchiusa, in
‘ N. Antologia ⁹, vol. 100, 1902, pp. 637-50.

For other accounts of his farm and manner of life at Vaucluse see Fam.
xiii. 8, xv. 3, xvi. 1, and cf. the De Vita Solitaria (especially ii. 10. 2), begun
at Vaucluse in 1346. Benetti-Brunelli, Le origini ital. d. scuola amanistica,
p. 34 seq., discusses Petrarch’s conception of the solitary life.
