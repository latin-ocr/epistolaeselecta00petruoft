216 ‚ NOTES

1341, or to Dionigi da Borgo San Sepolcro, whom he might certainly describe
as ‘ dux ingenii '. He too died sometime in 1341 (see Fam. iv. 1). There
is still the difficulty that both Giacomo and Dionigi died more than a year
before Robert. ’

27. Laelius. Lello di Piero Stefano was a Roman nobleman, who had
accompanied Giacomo Colonna to Lombez in 1330. There Petrarch met
him and he became an intimate friend. Petrarch called himrLaelius after
Scipio's friend. Laelius was at Avignon in Cardinal Giovanni's household
together with Petrarch. After the Cardinal’s death he returned to Rome.
In Fam. xix. 4 Petrarch writes a letter of recommendation for him to the
Emperor. Later we shall find Laelius again at Avignon (Fam. xx. 15).
He died in 1363 (Sen. iii. 1). (Cf. P. Mabille, P. et l’empereur Charles IV,

Angers, 1890, pp. 55-7.)

Fam. v. 3 [29 November 1343]

PAGE 26. At the death of King Robert‚ lus suecessor Joangwas barely
seventeen, and according to the King's will a regency was to be established
during the minority of her and Andrew of Hungary, her husband, who was -
still younger. The terms of the will had not been carried out, and the Pope
sent Petrarch to Naples in the autumn of 1343 on 3 mission in connexion
with the regency. What Petrarch’s instructions were and what he effected
is not known. At the same time he was commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni
Colonna to intercede on behalf of Giovanni Pipino and his two brothers.
The latter had been thrown into prison at Castel Capuano by King Robert
for acts of violence committed in the⁸ course of their feud with the Del
Marra family. From this and the following letters it appears that
Petrarch did not seem sanguine of any success, but the three brothers were
-. eventually released in the following year, and Giovanni Pipino took a leading
'part in the overthrow of Cola di Rienzo in Rome in December 1347. (See
Gregorovius, vol. vi, p. 312.)' ’
For the war between Milan and Pisa, which interfered with Petrarch’s
journey by land, see G. Giulini, Memoria spettanti alla storia . .. . di Milano,
1854, &c.‚ bk. lxvii, p. 325. The aristocratic party had tried to effect a

revolution in Pisa, and had been defeated, together with some adherents ›-

of the Visconti family. Thereupon Luchino Viseonti, the head of the family
and Lord of Milan at this time, sent an army todaxyenge the insult.

Line 18. i. e. by.the Benedictine monastery at Todi.

22. For Stefano Colonna the elder see Fam. viii. 1. Petrarch had last
seen him in Rome in 1337. He was at Avignon at the time of Petrarch’s
coronation in 1341.

44—5. Parthenope: Naples. Cf. Virg. Geo. iv. 564. A siren of that name
was said to have been buried there.
