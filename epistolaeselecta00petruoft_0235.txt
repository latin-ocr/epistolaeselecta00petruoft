interpretation of Aristotelism. Many of the scholars of this University were
Averrhoists at heart, though it might not be politic to proclaim it openly.
This was Petrarch‘s second main objection to the doctors, that they accepted
a materialistic philosophy fundamentally opposed to his own. (Cf. the
passage on philosophers at the opening of Fam. vi. 2.) In the third place
Petrarch objected to the formal methods of this school, to their appeal to
authority and uncritical acceptance of Aristotle or their interpretation of
Aristotle.

For a summary of Petrarch’s philosophy see G. Gentile, La filosofia, in
‘ Storia dei generi letterarii italiani’, Milan [1914], p. 166 seq.

There is one metrical epistle (ii. 5) also addressed to Clement VI, in which
Petrarch urges the Pope to return to Rome.

Fam. vi. 2 [30 November 1338 ?]

PAGE 38. This Colonna was a brother of Stefano the elder. He had been
exiled with other members of the family by Boniface VIII (cf. Fam. iv. 12,
’ l. 17, note) and had travelled in the East. Petrarch had met him at Avignon,
and during his visit to Rome in 1337 Giovanni had been his guide. There
are seven other letters to this friend, Fam. ii. 5—8, iii. 13, and vi. 3, 4,
according to Fracassetti’s identification 3 from them we gather that
Giovanni had suffered much from ill-health‚ and that he had become
a Franciscan. It was for his amusement that Petrarch wrote a comedy,
Philologia, which he afterwards destroyed. (See R. Sabbadini, La ‘ Philo·
logia ’ del P. e Terenzio, in ‘ Bollett. di filol. classica ⁷, xxii, 1915, fasc. 2, 3.

The year in which the letter was written is doubtful. It seems most
likely that it refers to the ‘visit to Rome in 1337, and it is clear that the
friends had not been long separated. The year 13 38 would fall in with the
chronological arrangement of the letters, which Petrarch aimed at, but
which is not always preserved. There seems to be no reference to the
poetical laurels and the journey of 1341. Giovanni is known to have died
at Tivoli soon after October 1343.

Lines 42-3. si coeperit se Roma cognoscere: if not a later interpola·
tion, this is a remarkable gorecasssffiof §yla di Rienzo’s revolution in
1347. It was their common enthusiasm for Rome which formed the
basis of the friendship between Cola and Petrarch. For Petrarch Rome,
with its Classical and ecclesiastical traditions, was the centre ,of the
universe. Cf. especially Fam. ii. 9, where he writes to Giacomo Colonna
on his longing to visit the city, and, Sen. vii. 1, to Pope Urban V, urging
him to return to Rome.
