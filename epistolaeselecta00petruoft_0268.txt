252 NOTES

Verme. The Count Amedeus VI, of Savoy, and the Visconti organized an
expedition against the Turks on behalf of the Eastern Emperor, John V.
Venice gave some help and sent out Luchino dal Verme (cf. P. Orsi, Signo-
rie e principati, p. 128); while away on that expedition in the East
Luchino died. In Sen. viii. 4, dated December 1366, Petrarch writes to
warn him against this undertaking.

The author of F. P. e Luchino dal V erme gives 1372 as the year of his
death3 but there can be little doubt that the date of the present letter is
1367, and that it was in that year that Luchino died. Moreover‚ Amedeus
was back in Venice on the 31st July 1367. Dal Verme’s son, Giacomo, to
whom the letter is addressed, also had a distinguishediqrssrilitary career. He
took part in the games described in Sen. iv. 3.

Petrarch writes to Boccaccio about the superstition of the sixty-third ,-

year3 he gives an account of the history of the superstition and a list of

authorities, including Aulus Gellius, Censorinus, and the astrologer ῃ
Maternus. The present letter was written just a year later at the opening -

of his sixty- -fourth year.

PAGE 172. The subject of this letter is the decay of Italy and the world in

general, but the extracts given are chosen rather for their bearing on ·

Petrarch‘s life and the history of his time. F racassetti dates the letter 1368.

The references are not all clear, but some at any rate seem to point to 1367; =

e. g. he says he was in Bologna three years ago, referring to a visit in 1364 ἑ

(see note to lines 70—3). Guido Sette, to whom the letter is addressed, died 3‘

in June 1368.
