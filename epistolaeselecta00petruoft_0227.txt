NOTES 211

und W erke, Leipzig, 1878, p. 124 seq., therefore gives 1333 as the date of this
letter. But Petrarch refers in the letter to Richard as a bishop, and he was
not made Bishop of Durham until December 1333. Koerting cuts the knot
by assuming a later interpolation. In view of the fact that Petrarch carefully
edited his letters, such interpolations are quite¹ possible. Petrarch had
a great interest in geography, and was well acquainted with the writings of
Pliny, Pomponius Mela, and other Roman writers on geography. Among
his writings is a geographical work, a description of the road to Palestine,
called Itinerarium. (See F. Novati, Il P. e i V isconti‚ in ‘ P. e la Lombardia ’,
pp. 44, 45.) On his interest in Thule see Lo Pareo, L’ultima Thule nell‘ in-
tuizione . . . di F. P. in ‘ Rivista geogr. ita1.'‚ 1911, p. 459, &c.

PAGE 11. In the early editions this letter is addressed to Tommaso Caloria
da Messina. From internal evidence this is clearly wrong. In the edition
of 1492·letters to unknown correspondents were marked with the initials

T. M. (titulo minutae), and later editors concluded that T. M. was Tommaso
³ da Messina. Hence a number of letters were wrongly addressed to that
friend. Humbert II, the last Dauphin of Vienne, was in an unfortunate
position on the outbreak of the war between Edward III and Philip os
France, as he was a vassal both of the Emperor, who was allied with
Edward III, and the King of France, Petrarch probably wrote thisletter

to order, in the interests of the F rench party. In 1349 Humbert bequeathed '⁷

his possessions to the King of France3 in 1351 he became a Dominican,
was made Patriarch of Alexandria by Clement VI, and died in 1355.

PAGE 13. In the early editions this letter is addressed ‘ Iohanni Colum-
nae ’, but F racassetti assigns it on internal evidence to Dionigi de’ Roberti
da Borgo San Sepolcro. Dionigi was an Augustinian, and was lecturing
on divinity and philosophy at the University of Paris from 1317. He
wrote a commentary on Valerius Maximus. See Bertalot, in La bibliofilia,

Dec. 1922, p. 262, seq. In 1333, while in Paris, Petrarch appears to have made
