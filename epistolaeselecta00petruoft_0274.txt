of St. Augustine’s Confessions‚ which he had received when in Paris in 1333 Δ
from Dionigi da Borgo San Sepolcro, also an Augustinian. This manuscript ,
is referred to on the occasion of the ascent of Mount Ventoux (Fam. iv. 1).
In Sen. xv. 6 Petrarch urges him to write against the Averrhoists. For
an account of Luigi see Salutati ‚Epistolario‚ vol. i ,.pp 243, 244,andG. Gen-

to Naples. Cf. Fam. v. 3.

Sen. xvi. 1 [27 April or 28 March 1374]

PAGE 194. This is the only letter to Luca da Penna (in the Abi-azzi), who

, was not personally known to Petrarch. He was a lecturer in law at the
University of Naples in the time of King Robert. He had written to ·

Petrarch on behalf of the Pope, Gregory X1,asking for information about .

manuscripts of Cicero. This letter gives a good account of Petrarch’s
enthusiasm for Cicero, and contains several details about his life not
otherwise known.

Line 13. In Fam xxiii. 14, to John, Bishop of Olmiitz, also Petrarch
discusses the use of the singular tu in addressing one person. It was
generally believed in the Middle Ages that the Romans had introduced the
plural first in addressing Julius Caesar. Cf. Dante, Par. xvi. 10 ‘ Dal “ voi ’⁹ ’
che prima Roma sofferie ’. This fact probably made Petrarch all the more ‚
eager to make the correction. But Petrarch was not consistent and some·⁴ ’
times uses the plural. (See V ar 10 and 18, and cf. Voigt, Die Briessamm-
lungenPJ s, p. 44.)

33. We know that Petrarch had a manuscript of Cicero's Letters to υ
Atticus, which he discovered at Verona in 1345. He may have sent the
‚Pope a copy of this manuscript, or knew that a copy had been sent· g
(Cf. O. Zenatti‚ Dante e Firenze, p. 299 note.)

46-7. St. Prosperus‚ a pupil of St. Augustine. His‘ Chronicon’ was
widely used in schools in the Middle Ages. The Aesop referred to is the
paraphrase known as ‘ Romulus ’. ’

69. septennium: at the Universities of Montpellier and Bologna,
1319-26.

80. Now known as the De Inventione. But others of Cicero’s works on Ἴ
rhetoric may be included in this description.

87. secundum: Fracassetti thinks this is a mistake for sextum, aa κ
Petrarch was in his twenty-sixth year (in 1330) when he was introduced by
Giacomo to his family. But Petrarch may be thinking of his firstintroduction χ
to Giacomo soon after his return from Bologna in his twenty-second year. '

109. in V asconiam = the journey to Lombez in 1330. (See Fam. i. 4.) “

1 15. quadragesimus annus τ this expression fixes the date of the present
letter as 1 374. That date is supported by a reference to the death of Giacomo, ,ι
