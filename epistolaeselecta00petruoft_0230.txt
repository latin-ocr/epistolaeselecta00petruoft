214 NOTES

8th Apri13 possibly the re‘ading should be ‘ vi. Idus ’. That was the last
day of Orso's office as senator (cf. Fam. ii. 13).

9. Giovanni Barrili„ whom Petrarch also met at the Court of King
Robert. He had been deputed to represent the King at the coronation, but
owing to the mishap here related (cf. the note to Fam. ii. 13) arrived too
late. There are· two prose letters, Fam. xii. 13 and V ar. 57, and three
metrical epistles, ii. 1, iii. 13 and 21, addressed to him. See also L. Mascetta
Caraeci‚ B. di Sulmona ed i suoi amici, Barrili e P.‚ in the ‘ Rassegna Abruz-
zese di storia ’, ii. 1898.

Fam. iv. 9 [23 May 1341]

PAGE 21. In 1335 the Della Scala family of Verona had seized Parma
from the Rossi, and entrusted the town to Guido da Correggio. His brother,
Azzo, and Guglielmo da Pastrengo were sent to Avignon to get the Pope’s
sanction for this act. From that visit dated Petrarch’s friendship with
Azzo and Guglielmo. Petrarch successfully pleaded their cause before the
Pope against the claims of the Rossi. Azzo was an early example of the ‚
,N typical Renaissance prince, a vigorous man of great ability, a lover of
· learning, and utterly unscrupulous in politics. He appears to have been
in Naples with Petrarch at the examination before King Robert. At the
date of the present letter he and his brothers seized Parma for themselves
with the help of Luchino Visconti. They made an agreement to hand
over the town to the Visconti in four years, an agreement which was broken
when in 1344 they surrendered it to Obizzo d’ Este (cf. Ι. ΑΗό, Storia . . .
di Parma, 1795, tom. iv, bk. 6, and F. Berlan‚ Parma liberata dal giogo di
Mastino della Scala, &c., Bologna, 1870 (Dispensa cix of the ‘ Scelta di
curiosita lett.’)). From this letter it appears that Cardinal Colonna was
aware of their plans for the occupation of the town. On the present occasion
Petrarch stayed with them for nearly a year. In 1346 Petrarch received
a canonry at Parma, and in 1348 was made Archdeacon (see Fam. vii. 1).
(See C. Cipolla, F. P. e le sue relazioni colla Corte Avignonese, etc„ Tutin,
1909, p. 30.) He bought a house there, and there too he completed
his epic poem Africa. Cf. A. Ronchini‚ La dimora del P. in Parma,
in ‘Atti della R. Deputazione di storia patria per le province moden.
e parm.’‚ 1874, vol. vii, p. 343 seq. , For Petrarch’s second visit to Parma
see Fam. v. 10.

Guglielmo da Pastrengo had studied law at the University of Bologna,
and was afterwards Procurator of Verona. Petrarch's friendship with him
continued until his death in 1363. He was a man of learning, and has left
a biographieal dictionary entitled De originibus rerum. See R. Sabbadini‚
Le scoperte dei codici latini e greci ne' secoli xiv e xv, Florence, 1905, pp. 4-22.
