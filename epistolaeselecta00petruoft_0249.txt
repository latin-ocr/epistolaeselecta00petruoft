Fam. xvi. 1 [5 january 1353]

’ PAGE 93. Cardinal Talleyrand, of the family of the Counts of Perigord, .

was a distinguished churchman, created Cardinal by John XXII in 1331.
He used his great influence on the side of the French popes against the
Italian interest, and played a large part in the election of Clement VI. He
was the uncle of Charles of Durazzo, who was suspected of being concerned

’ in the murder of Andrew‚ the husband of Queen Joan of Naples, and some

suspicion was cast on the Cardinal himself. Guy de Montfort, son of the
Count of Auvergne‚ was another great church dignitary. He was connected
with the royal family of France and with the Emperor, and was employed
on many important diplomatic missions. In various letters Petrarch praises
these two Cardinals for their activity on behalf of ἕω. On Petrarch’s
return to Avignon‚ in 1351, he was recommended to these two Cardinals
by his friend Philip, the Bishop of Cavaillon. In Fam. xiii. 1, he writes
a consolatory letter to Cardinal Guido on the death of his mother, Mary of
Flanders. Guido appears to have been less well disposed towards Petrarch
in later years. Cf. Sen. xiii. 12.

The two Cardinals had summoned Petrarch to Avignon on the occasion
of the election of the new Pope, Innocent VI.

On Petrarch’s ‘ villicus ’, Raymond Monet, cf. Fam. xiii. 8.
