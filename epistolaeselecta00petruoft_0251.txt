PAGE 99. The Legatus a latere, whom Petrarch here meets on his entry into
Milan, was Cardinal Aegidius d’ Alborn0z‚ distinguished as a diplomatist
and soldier. It was he who brought back the Papal States under the
authority of the Church, and finally facilitated Urban V's return to Rome
in 1367. He was the most vigorous opponent of the schemes of the Visconti
throughout the period during which Petrarch was at their Court. See Orsi,
Signorie e principati, p. 109 seq. The ‘ dominus ’ of the beginning of the
.1etter is the Archbishop Giovanni Visconti, and the ‘ magnanimus ado·
lescens ' Galeazzo ΙΙ, Giovanni’s nephew. During the reign of Luchino
Visconti (died 1349), his nephews‚ Matteo ΙΙ, Galeazzo II, and Bernab6‚
Stefano's son, had been in exile. Soon after the Archbishop Giovanni had
succeeded his brother Luchino, he recalled his nephews, recognized them
as his heirs, and forecasted a division of the state amongst them. To
¹ Galeazzo were assigned the territories west of Milan. Thus Petrarch could
say that he expected to inherit Milan and ⁴ Liguria ’. See Giulini‚ M emorie
spetianti alla storia . . . di M dano, lxvii, p. 353 seq.

As to Petrarch’s gratitude to and affection for Galeazzo cf. Sen. viii. 3
(November 1366), where, in writing to Tommaso del Garbo, a distinguished
doctor of Florence, he describes Galeazzo’s sufferings from the gout and
praises him for his many virtues.

PAGE 101. Guido Sette (as his name should be, not Settimo) had been a
friend of Petrarch's from boyhood. The two families had gone to Avignon
in 1312, and afterwards Guido, Petrarch, and his brother had been together
at school at CarpentraS, and at the Universities of Montpellier and Bologna.
Cf. Sen. x. 2. Guido was now Archdeacon of Genoa, andin 1358 Archbishop.
Most of his life was spent at Avignon, until he became Archbishop of Genoa.
His family came from Genoa. Several of Petrarch’s letters to him are
concerned with the relations of ἱ(Ξςῐῆιρὲικεέῐιεί Venice. He refers to these
letters at the beginning of the present letter. See also Fam. xix. 9.
Shortly after this letter was written ‚Petrarch's villa at Vaucluse was
robbed and burnt, but his „books were saved. (Cf. Sen. x. 23 V ar. 25, and
Sen. xvi .1.) San Colombano, from which place Petrarch is writing, is south-

east of Milan, not far from Pavia. Here he was the guest of the Visconti.
