Epistolae De Rebus F amiliaribus and Epistolae Variae, an
edition containing many letters not before printed. The text
of the present selection for the Epistolae de Rebus F amiliaribus

and Variae is that of Fracassetti, with some slight alterations
¹ of spelling and punctuation, to bring it into conformity with
the usual English practice. Fracassetti's edition was not based
on a very wide collation of manuscripts and is far from satis-
factory. A national edition of the whole of the letters is at
present being prepared by an Italian scholar, Professor Vittorio
Rossi, and we may expect before long to have a definitive text.
For the Epistolae De Rebus Senilihm, which have not been
edited in modern times, the Basle edition of Petrarch’s works,
printed by Sebastian Henricpetri in 1581, has been followed, -
with considerable alterations of spelling and punctuation.
The letters chosen from the Epistolae de Rebus Senilibus have
been collated with the Venice edition of the works printed by
Bevilacqua in 1503. This edition is in many respects better
than the Basle edition, and has frequently supplied a more
correct reading. It has not been thought necessary to mention
in the notes every reading adopted from the Venice edition.
Any alteration, other than obvious misprintS‚ not derived from
Fracassetti or from either the Basle or Venice edition, has been

commented on in the notes, or enclosed in a square bracket.

The numbering and arrangement of the letters is that of
Fracassetti—of his Italian translation for the Epistolae de Rebus

S'enilibus—except that the few Epistolae Variae and the one
Epistola sine Titulo given have been incorporated in a suitable
chronological order.

Fracassetti also published an Italian translation with a
commentary of the whole of the letters except the Epistolae
sine Titulo. This commentary has been of great use in making
the notes to this selection. But much work on the biography
of Petrarch has been done since Fracassetti’s day, and it has
been possible to correct many of his statements and his chrono-
logy of the letterS. The principal works of which use has been
