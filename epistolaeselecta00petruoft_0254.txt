23—4. praedonum coetus: German troops had entered Italy at various “

times in the previous thirty years (e. g. with Louis of Bavaria and john of
Bohemia). They had remained in Italy, and lived by brigandage when not
engaged by an Italian State. They gradually formed themselves into
increasingly large ‘ compagnie di ventura ’. The ‘Great Company ’ was
formed about 1342 by Duke Walter von Urslingen ; another ‘ Great
Company ’ was organized by &a Moriale‚ and afterwards taken over by
Conrad Landau (Conte Lando). This is the company to which Petrarch
here alludes. The close of the war between England and France in 1360 led
to the formation of further com'panies, some of which found their way to
Italy, notably the ‘ White Company ⁹, under Sir John Hawkwood. See
