out for Rome to pay a visit to Cola da Rienzo, but he changed his plans at
Genoa and went to Lombardy instead.

Fam. xi. 3 [10 May 1351]

PAGE 67. Giovanni Aghinolfi of Arezzo was Chaneellor of the Gonzagas of
Mantua. Through his connexion with Guido Gonzaga, Petrarch had made
acquaintance with Giovanni3 a number of letters are addressed to him.
Later in life Petrarch had another friend of the same name.

Giacomo II of Carrara had repeatedly invited Petrarch to Padua, and in
March 1349 Petrarch responded to the invitation3 during the next two
years he was frequently there. (See A. Zardo, Il P. e i Carraresi, p. 145.)
In 1349 Giacomo bestowed on him a “canonry in that town. The con-
temporary historians speak highly of Giacomo for the justice of his rule
and patronage of men of letters, but he was no exception among the un·
scrupulous and cruel princes of his age in Italy. In 1345 110 had seized the
lordship of Padua by murdering his cousin with his own hand. On the
zlst December 1350 he in his turn was murdered by another cousin. Petrarch
arrived at Padua shortly after this mgedy on his return from Rome. His
relations with Francesco, Giacomo's son, were equally friendly, as we shall
see in later letters. (Cf. Petrarch’s account of his relations with the family
in the Letter to Posterity.)

The Latin elegiacs Petrarch wrote on this occasion are still to be read on
Giacomo’s tomb in the church of the Eremitani at Padua, the tomb having
been transferred thither when the church of St. Agostino was destroyed in
1819.

Fam. xi. 6 [1 June 1351]
PAGE 69. Boccaccio and Petrarch probably met for the first time in 1350,
when Petrarch passed through Florence on his way to Rome for the Jubilee
(see Fam. xi. 1, the first extant letter addressed to Boccaccio). Petrarch's
words in Fam. xxi. 15 seem to leave no doubt that this was the first occasion
on which they actually inet. Boccaccio’s account is not so definite3 after
Petrarch’s death he wrote ‘ quadraginta annis vel amplius suus fui '. One
clear fact is that Boccaccio knew Dionigi da Borgo San Sepolcro at Naples
in 1338. (Cf. H. Hauvette, Boccace, Paris, 1914, pp. 195-8.) In December .
1350 Petrarch again visited Florence on his return from Rome, and in
the spring of 1351 Boccaccio was the bearer of a letter to Petrarch, then at
Padua with the Da Carrara, from the city of Florence, in which the decree
of exile against Petrarch’s family was withdrawn, his patrimony restored
to him, and in which he was invited to take a chair at the new University
⁶ of F lorence. Petrarch replied to this letter on the 6th June in very vague
terms, and we shall see that he never did return to Florence. For hio
reasons for declining this invitation, see Benetti-Brunelli, Le origini italiana
