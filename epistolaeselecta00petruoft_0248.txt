PAGE 87. F rancesco Nelli, Prior of the Church of the Apostles at Florence,
was one of the friends Petrarch made at Florence on his first visit there in
1350. He became intimate with Petrarch, and the Epist. Sen. are dedicated
” to him. He is called Simonides in the later letters. His letters to Petrarch
have been edited by H. Cochin in Un ami de Ρέινανςιιε, Paris, 1892. See

PAGE 90. Zanobi da Strada was another of the friends Petrarch made at
Florence in 1350. He was a schoolmaster, scholar, and poet.

Petrarch held that men of letters should be disinterested in their pursuit
of knowledge, and further that to extend the sphere of knowledge was
a higher duty than that of instruction (cf. Benetti-Brunelli, Le origini ital.
d. scuola umanistica, pp. 48, 49, and 175). Therefore in 1352 he advised
Zanobi to abandon the profession of schoolmaster and go to Naples under
the patronage of Niccolo Acciaiuoli. There is a difficulty, at present un-
solved, as to this date 1352 and the date of the present letter. F. Forcellini,
in an article in ‘ Archiv. stor. Nap.' 1912, p. 242, seq. produces'a document,
dated November 1349, showing that Zanobi was already in Naples at that
date. Forcellini therefore assigns the present letter and several others to
1349. But the letters were written from Avignon and the internal evidence
shows that that address is not a later addition. F orcellini’s argument that
the internal evidence proves that these letters were written in Gallia
Cisalpina is founded on a mistranslation by F racassetti. In 1355 by the
influence of Acciaiuoli Zanobi receivednst—hnep-th'ss‘ laurel wreath from the
Emperor Charles IV, during his visit to Italy. Petrarch was by no means
pleased at this rivalry, Q remained on friendly terms with Zanobi, and
in 1359 helped him to obtain the post of papal secretary. Petrareh's dis·
pleasure was shared by his friends 3 they knew Zanobi's limitations. Cf.
R. Renier, Liriche . . . di Fazio degli Uberti, Florence, 1883, p. ccv, note.
Zanobi died in 1361.
