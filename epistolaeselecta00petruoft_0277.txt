NOTES 261

This letter forms a preface to Petrarch's translation of the story of
Griselda. From Sen. xvii. 1 it appears that the translation and presumably
the preface were written before the 28th April 1373, the date of Sen. xvii. 2.
(ef. Zardo, Il P. e i Carraresi, p. 206 seq.‚ for the dates of the last letters

to Boccaccio. .
It is well krlown that Chaucer attributes the story of Griselda to Petrarch.

He possibly met Petrarch at Padua in 1373, and heard this story directly

The autobiographical value of this has been doubted, because it was believed
that Petrarch was at Arqua at the time of Chaucer's visit to Italy. But
from the letters it is clear that Petrarch was in Padua from November 1372
to September 1373. Cf. the chapter on Chaucer and Petrarch in C. Segre,
studi petrarcheschi‚ pp. 257-79.
