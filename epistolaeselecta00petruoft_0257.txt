NOTES 241

Hauvette (Boccace, p. 357) thinks this visit exercised a deciding influence
on Petrarch's later life.

There is frequent mention in the correspondence of lost or delayed letters
(e. g. F am. xx. 6) due to the thefts of uncouth admirers of the new learning, or
the companies of mercenaries who infested Italy. But Petrarchskept copies
of his letters, and here we find him engaged in the work of editing them.

Lines 2-4. From Suetonius’ Life of Horace. ’ ⁴⁴ .

PAGE 11⁷. There are two letters to Laelius (Fam. xx. 13, 14) about this
quarrel with Socrates, one exhorting him to end their dispute, and the
second congratulating him on their renewed friendship. Both these friends
were at Avignon at this time.

Fam. xxi. 11 [15 October 1359]

PAGE 118. Neri Morando, of Forli, was Secretary of the Republic of
Venice in the time of Andrea Dandolo; afterwards he was in the service
of the Emperor Charles, and accompanied him on bis journey to Italy in
1354 and 13 55. There are seven letters addressed to him. (Cf. G. Voigt‚
Die Briessammlungen P’s., p. 35.)

In a later letter (Fam. xxii. 11) to Guglielrno da Pastrengo Petrarch
recommends the Enrico Capra of this letter, who had gone to study at Verona.

This letter was written from⁴a house placed at Petrarch’s disposal by the
Visconti at Pagazzano, eighteen kilometres from Bergamo‚ on the Adda.
This has been recentlyqd‘emonstrated by documentary evidence 3 see G. Riva,
in ‘ Archiv. stor. lomb.’, December 1922, pp. 404-6.

Lines 1-2. In the previous letter to Morando Petrarch has described
how he received an injury from the falling down of his manuscript of
Cicero’s Letters. See also V ar. 25.

Fam. xxi. 15 [1359]

PAGE 120. Boccaccio‚ possibly in 1352 or 1353 (if one can accept the title
in a Florence MS„ Cod. Palat. 323), sent to Petrarch at Avignon a manu-
script οἱ the Commedia, together with a short Latin poem beginning ‘ Italiae
iam certus honos ’. (See G. Traversari‚ Il Bocc. e l’ invio della Commedia al
P.‚ ‘ Giornale Dantesco '‚ xiii, pp. 25 seq.) Petrarch’s reply has not been
preserved. In 1359 Boccaccio wrote to Petrarch ‚ggqlogizing for his ad-

miration for Dante. This letter also has been lost. The present letter is
