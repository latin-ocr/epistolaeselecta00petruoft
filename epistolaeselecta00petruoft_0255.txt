28-9. The defeat of Galata in the Bosphorus in 13523 the victory of
Alghero (29 August 1353) off the coast of Sardinia ; the final defeat was at
Portolongo in the island of Sapienza (4 November 1354). (Cf. V. Lazzarini‚
La battaglia di Portolongo, Venice, 1894.)

35. The Doge Andrea Dandolo (see Fam. xi. 8) died on the 7th Septem-
ber 13 54, before the battle of Portolongo.

49. The date of Marin Faliero's birth is not known, but he was between
sixty-nine and seventy·four years old when elected Doge. (Cf. V. Laz-
zarini‚ M. F aliero avanti il Dogado, in ‘ Nuovo Archiv. Veneto ’‚ tom. v,
1893, p. 105.) Dandolo was only thirty-six when he became Doge in 1343.

’ 75. scalasque marmoreas: these stairs were on the same side, but at
the opposite end, as the extant ‘ Scala dei giganti .’. They were demolished
in the sixteenth century. (Cf. V. Lazzarini‚ M. F aliero : La congium, p. 37.)

78. XIV Kalendas Maii : Petrarch appears to be a day out here. There
seems to be no doubt that Faliero was beheaded on the same day as the

sentence was passed upon him, i.e. the 17th April. (See Lazzarini‚ M.
F aliero : La congiura, p. 107.)

Fam. xix. 13 [19 May 1356]
PAGE 111. Petrarch had been very well received by the Emperor when he
was in' Italy in 1354 and 1 3 55, and partly no doubt for that reason the
Visconti in 1356 sent him on the mission here referred to. They were
surrounded by enemies, and were anxious to improve their relations with the
Emperor, lest he should join the league against them. The league had been
formed by the Marquis of Este, the Marquis of Montferrat, and the Gonzaga‚
who had approached the Emperor. The Emperor pretended to have been
offended by the Visconti, and cited thern before his representative, Mar-
quard, Bishop of Augsburg‚ for the 11th October. (Cf. Giulini, Memorie
spettanti alla storia . . . di M ilano, bk. lxviii, pp. 417-20.) Petrarch ex·
pected to find Charles at Basle, but after waiting a month in vain, he had
to continue his journey to Prague. There he was received with honour

and created Count Palatine. He was back in Milan in September. (See
A. Hortis, Scrim· inediti di F. P., pp. 157-62.)
