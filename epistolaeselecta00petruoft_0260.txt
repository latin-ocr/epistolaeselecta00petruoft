58-60. Ecclesiastes i. 8.

Fam. xxiii. 1'9 [28 October 1366]

PAGE 130. For the young man here referred to, whether Giovanni Malpa·
ghini or another, see the note to Sen. xi. 9.

The letter appears to belong to 1366. Petrarch refers to the first visit of '4

Boccaccio paid to him 111 Venice, which was in 1363, and says that the
young man came to him a year afterwards. Further on he says he had

been with him for two years. The letter is written from Pavia, where we γ ’

know Petrarch was in November 1366. It is strange that Petrarch should
include among the Epist. F am. a letter written more than three years later
than any other letter in that collection.

Line 4. For Donato degli Albanzani see San. xi. 2, 1. 59, note.

8. Boccaccio is believed to have been in Ravenna about 1346, in the ζ

time of Ostasio da Polenta. In 1365 Guido da Polenta‚ ‚his grandson, was ⁴
lord of Ravenna. (Cf. Hauvette, Boccace, p. 181.) ’

Fam. xxiv. 2 [13 May 1351]

PAGE 133. The name of this correspondent was Arrigo da Custoza‚ called '

Pulice; except that he wrote Latin poems nothing more is known about Ῑ
him. The letter was written in 1351 when Petrarch was on his way back ¹
from Padua to Vaucluse. He tells us in Fam. xxiv. 13, to Socrates, that all
the letters &dressed to Qreek and Roman authors are placed together,
and not in chronological sequence with the others The letter to Pulice
is presumably placed with them because of its connexion with the two
addressed to Cicero, which follow it in Book xxlv.

Line 63. Quint. Inst. x. 2. 18. Petrarch had received a manuscript of ' 'e
Quintilian from Lapo da Castiglionchio in 1350. ¹
