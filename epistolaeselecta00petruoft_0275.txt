NOTES 259

here omitted, which occurred in September 1341 3 Petrarch says itis now
the thirty-third year since that event.

120. Sallust, Bell. lug„ ch. 19. Quoted also ιιι Fam. ii. 13.

133. i. e. the manuscript of Homer, which he received from Sigerus in
1354. (See Fam. xviii. 2.) Petrarch does not seem to be quite accurate

Δ here, at least, there ιε no reason to suppose he asked Sigerus to send the

manuscript of Cicero rather than Greek manuscripts.

mea ope et impensa· see Sen. iii. 6, note tol. 57. Again Petrarch does .-
not seem to be fluite truthful, All Petrarch did was to have a copy made
at his own expense. He is evidently trying to impress his correspondent.

135. Virg. Geo. i. 145.

136. Petrarch bought a manuscript of St. Augustine’ s De civitate Dei
as early as 1325, according to a marginal note on that manuscript. (See
P. de Nolhac, P. ἁ Bologne au temps d'Azzo V isconti, in ⁴ P. ela Lombardia ‘,
pp. 87—93. F. Lo Pareo in the ‘ Giorn. stor. d. lett. ital.’‚ 1906, pp. 35—42,
thinks the date should be 1335. Petrarch first quotes the De Civitate in
Fam.,ii. 9, dated December 1336.) ·

' 139-40. Nondum sane sanctorum: in later life Petrarch studied the
F athers much more, especially while at Milan. (Cf. Fam. xxii. 10 and de
Nolhac, P. et l'humanisme, 1907, tom. ii, p. 190.) V

144-7. Quint. Inst. x. 1. 1123 and 125 for the account of Seneca. On
Petrarch's manuscript of Quintilian see Fam. xviii. 12, note.

153. This visit to Liege must have been in 1333, though Petrarch here
says it was in his twenty-fifth year. It is generally agreed that he made
only one journey to Belgium, and that in 1333. Cf. the note to Fam. iiim.
On that occasion he found a copy of Cicero’s Pro Archia, to'which he here
refers. He sent a copy of this to Lapo da Castiglionchio (V ar. 45).

163. ¹Aug. Confessions, iii. 4 and viii. 7.

173-4. Aug. De Trinitate, xiv. 9. The De Laude Phil. is now known as
Hortensius. Both this treatise and the De Consolatione are still amongst
the lost works. ⁴

182. Neapoli: i. e. the visit of 1343.

193. The letter referred to is one of the earliest, Fam. i. 2, to Raimondo
Soranzo.

202-5. This statement that Petrarch knew the lost work De Gloria has
been generally accepted, but P. de Nolhac (P. et l’humanisme, Paris, 1907,
tom. i, p. 260 seq.) throws considerable doubt on it. He suggests that
Petrarch had an unnamed work on the subject of Glory, and ιιι later years,

finding that Cicero had written a book called De Gloria, persuaded himself ,

that he had once possessed it. Cf. the story Petrarch has himself related
of a part of the Academics. The whole of the chapter on Cicero in

de Nolhac bears on this letter.
