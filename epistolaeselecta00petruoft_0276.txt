As to Varro, de Nolhac is of the opinion that Petrarch knew only that i
portion of his works known to us.

212. In his omnibus· i. e. in all the works of Cicero he had. The De q
Gloria did not belong to his father, but came from Raimondo Soranzo. f*

221. magister: Convenevole da Prato, schoolmaster at Carpentras, where ἐ
Petrarch was at school till 1319. See Fam. v. 1, note, l. 24. ς

224. Horace, Ars Poet. 304, 305. > 1

230. Niccolb da Prato, Bishop of Ostia. He was sent by the Pope to ³¹
negotiate between the Blacks and the Whites at Florence in 1304 (Villani,
viii. 69). One of Qnte's letters is addressed to him. He died in 1321.

241. [sublevaveram] ε was suggested by Nolhac, P. et l'humanisme, 1907,
tom. i, p. 261.

275. Maias ε the Colbert MS. at Paris reads Aprilis.

On Petrarch' s library, in addition to P. de Nolhac quoted above, see s
R. Sabbadini, Il primo nucleo della bibl. del P., in ‘Rendiconti’ of the ’
R. Istituto Lombardo, vol. xxxix, 1906, fase. 6, pp. 369-88. ’

sen. xvi. 7 [28'Apri1 1373]

PAGE 202. Nothing is known of this grammarian of Piacenza, except that ’
his name was probably Donnino, and not Janino. He can hardly be the
same man as Donnino of Parma, a friend of Boccaccio. (See Hauvette,
Boccace, pp. 417—20.) There is one other letter to him on a similar theme,
Sen. xvi. 6, in which Petrarch gives an account of the encouragement he ⁴
had himself received in his studies as a youth from gne Giovanni da j
Firenze.

The story here related of the old man of Perugia refers to Petrarch’s
visit to Naples and Rome for his coronation in 1341. One of the early lives ,
of Petrarch(by Lelio de’ Leli) says this old man was Stramazzo da Perugia,
who wrote a sonnet to Petrarch. But Petrarch’s reply, Rime xxiv, was
written some years before 1341, so that this identification seems impossible. ‚

Line 13. Peter of Poitiers is Pierre le Bercheur, the first F rench translator
os Livy. There are two letters to him, Fam. xxii. 13, 14, relating to King
John of F rance, and drawing a contrast between military science in ancient ,
’ Rome and in modern times.

72. urbis illius dominus: Azzo da Correggio. Cf. Fam. iv. 9.

Sen. xvii. 3 [1373]
PAGE 205. After a friendship of more than twenty years with Eacaceia,
we find that Petrarch (if he is truthful here) has only just read parts
of the Decameron. We can only compare his slighting references to his own
vernacular poems and his somewhat patronizing attitude towards Dante.
