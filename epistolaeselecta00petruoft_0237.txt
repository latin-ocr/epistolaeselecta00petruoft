Fam. viii. 1 [8 September 1349]

PAGE 46. whatever coolness there may have arisen between Petrarch and
the Colonna family owing to his support of Cola di Rienzo, his indebtedness
to various members of the family made it only natural that he should write
to the elder Stefano on this sad occasion. Petrarch had certainly made
some cutting remarks about the Roman nobles, including the Colonna, but
in any case a man of action like Stefano probably gave little heed to

Petrarch’s political views. For the privilege which Petrarch claimed of
advising the rulers of Italy see the note to Fam. xii. 1.

Petrarch first met the elder Stefano at Avignon in 1331. The sonnet
Rime x was possibly written then. We have had an account in F am. v. 3
of Petrarch’s visit to stefano on his journey to Naples in 1343. Of Stefano’s
seven legitimate sonS, Giacomo had died in 1341, the eldest son Stefano,
with his son Giovanni and several other members of the family, was killed
¹ in Rome in the fighting against Cola on the zoth November 1347 (stefano the
elder has often been confused with his son and said to have fallen in this fray),
and now his second son, the Cardinal Giovanni‚ was dead. Stefano himself
died soon after the date of this letter, which is the only one addressed to him.

Fam. viii. 3 [18 May 1349]

PAGE 49. This letter introduces two of Petrarch's most intimate friends,
Socrates and Olympius. For Socrates see the next letter. Luca Cristiano,
to whom Petrarch gave the name of Olympius, was probably a native of
Piacenza‚ though he seems to have had family affairs at Rome or Teano
(see Fam. viii. 7). He had studied law with Petrarch at Bologna, and was
afterwards a member of Cardinal Giovanni Colonna's household at Avignon.
Petrarch was now at Parma, and was anxious to persuade Socrates, Luca,
and his third intimate, Mainardo Accursio of Florence, to join him in Italy.
But when he wrote this letter Mainardo was already §.ead- In the next
letter Petrarch relates the story of his tragic end, and describes the characters
of Mainardo and Luca. From that letter we see that Petrarch was for many
months in doubt as to the fate of Luca. He had in fact returned to Avignon.
In 1352 Petrarch resigned in his favour a canonry he had received at Modena.
