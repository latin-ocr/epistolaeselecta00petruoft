him his confessor, as we gather from the present letter, and received a manu·
script of St. Augustine’s Confessions from him. This same manuscript he
afterwards presented to Luigi Marsili (see Sen. xv. 7). In 1338 Dionigi
returned to Florence, passing through Avignon on his way. In 1339 he was
invited to Naples by King Robert. Both he and King Robert were interested
in astrology, a study which Petrarch detested. In G. Villani, x. 86, there is
an account of Dionigi’s foretelling the death of Castruccio Castracani. The
older authorities state definitely that Dionigi died on the 14th January ι 342,
but if, as seems likely, he is the same Dionigi mentioned by Boccaccio in a
letter of the 29th August 1341, he must have died somewhat earlier(cf. A. della
Torre, La Giovinezza del Boccaccio, Citra di Castello, 1905, pp. 145—7.) On
Dionigi see R. Sabbadini, Le scoperte dei cod. lat. e grec„ &a Nuove ricerche.

Petrarch’ s desire to receive the laurel crown was no secret (cf. the passage
about Laura and‘ laurea' in Fam. ii. 9, and the Canzone ‘ Una donna piu
bella assai che ’l sole '——though it is possible that in that poem Petrarch
means the glory arising from moral perfectiori rather than from learning).
By the aid of his influential friends he attained his object in 1341. We have
