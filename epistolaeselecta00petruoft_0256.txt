240 NOTES

Line 3. Ecclesiasticus xl. 1.

7. iuvenis . . . vidi: referring to his journey in 1333 (Fam. i. 4).

9. bicornis: cf. Virg. Aen. viii. 727. ’

20. indignam fugam: Charles had returned from Rome and crossed
Lombardy in June 1355 with only 1,200 horsemen, and had not been
allowed to enter the cities, which wished to escape his exactions. The name
of the Emperor had become discredited3 hence Petrarch’s ‘indigna’.
See the note to Fam. xii. 1.

Fam. xix. 16 [1357]

PAGE 112. For Guido Sette see Fam. xvii. 5. Fracassetti dated this
present letter 13583 but Petrarch says he has been at Milan four years,
and is now entering on his fifth year. As he settled at Milan in May 1353,
the letter must belong to 1357. Guido did not become Archbishop of
Genoa until 1358, and probably the heading should be ‘ Archidiacono ’.

It was thought that Petrarch gave the name of ‘ Linterno ' to this villa
at Garignano, after the name of Scipio's country house. The statement
occurs in the life of Petrarch by Squarciafico, included in the 1581 edition
of his works‚ and has been repeated in all subsequent biographies. A. Annoni

in Il P. in villa in ‘ P. e la Lombardia '‚ pp. 97—127‚ has 'shown how the· ι

mistake arose, and that in the only passage in the letters in which the villa
is so called (V ar. 46) the reading is at fault. The confusion with the village
of Interno‚ which is not far from Garignano, had been already pointed out
by C. Romussi, P. a Mihmo, Milan, 1874, pp. 67—72.

Line 12. hospes tuus sui t at Avignon from 13 51-3 ; but for much of that
time Petrarch was at Vaucluse.

34. huic solum Italorum : Galeazzo ΙΙ, Visconti.

45. Ambrosixfl-ospes: in Fam. xvi. 11 Petrarch has already mentioned
this house. Afterwards he lived in the convent of San Simpliciano, outside
the old city walls. Cf. E. Galli, Le ville del P. nel Milanese, in ‘ Archiv.
stor. lombardo ⁹, ser. 4, vol. iii, 1905, pp. 359-69.

76. Raritas autem ε for Petrarch's friends at Milan see F. Novati, P. e i
V isc-onti, in ‘ P. e la Lombardia ⁹, pp. 40-7.

80. Sen. Ep. 94. 1.
90. Carthusia domus nova z founded by Galeazzo ΙΙ.

Fam. xx. 7 [11 April 1359]

PAGE 115. The friend about whose return Petrarch here expresses his
anxiety is ᾗῙΞρσεεειεείο, who had just paid him a short visit at Milan. Cf. P. de
Nolhac, P. et l'humanisme, 1907, ii. 267, where it is shown that Boccaccio
was at Milan on the 16th March. He left on the 1 1th April and was back
in Florence on the 17th May, according to Nelli (Cochin, Un ami de P., xxiii,

p. 265).
