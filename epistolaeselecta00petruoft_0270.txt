254 NOTES

Sen. xi. 2 [21 July 1368]
PAGE 179. Francesco Bruni, a Florentiae, was appointed Papal Secretary
by Urban V (sen. i. 4, note, 1. 75). ,Ρεῖτειτεὴ had been corresponding with

him since 1361, though he had never met him. An account of Bruni will be J

found in Coluccio Salutati, Epistolario, ed. F. Novati, i. pp. 42, 43.
Petrarch had been summoned to Pavia by Galeazzo Visconti to assint in
the negotiations for peace between his family and the Church. He was
present at the marriage of Violante, daughter of Galeazzo, to Lionel‚ Duke
of Clarence, son of Edward III, on the 5th June, at Milan. The visconti

’ were at war with a league of* most of the othei-‘princes of North Italy,

backed up by the Pope and the King of Hungary. The employment of
the Great Company and other bands of foreign mercenaries 'made the
whole country unsafe for travellers. The description of this journey is
completed in a recently discovered letter, ‘ Ioannolo de Mandello ⁹, edited
by F. Novati in P. ela Lombardia, p. 51.

Line 49. Francesco da Carrara.

59. Donato degli Albanzani. The Pope's letter, which his friend brought, j
contained an invitation to Petrarch to come to Rome. The second letter .

of Petrarch’s‚ which the Pope had not then received, is Sen. ix. 1, written to
congratulate the Pope on his return to Rome. OnAlbanzani see Salutati,
Epistolario, ii, pp. 68, 302, 303, and F. Novati, D. degli Albanzani alla corte
estense, in ‘ Archiv. stor. ital.’, 1890, ser. 5, tom. vi, pp. 365—85. He was
born at Pratovecchio about 1330, and was for many years a schoolmaster
in Venice, and afterwards at Ravenna.

68. Coluccio Salutati, the humanist. He had, recently been appointed
Papal Secretary in conjunction with Bruni. See the §.didon of his letters
9511th by F . Novati, op. cit., and F. Novati, La giovinezza di Coluccio S.‚
Turin, 1888.

Sen. xi. 9 [1368]

PAGE 181. Ugo di San Severino was one of Petrarch’s Neapolitan friends.
He was attached to the Court of Queen Joan and *captain of her forces. Fam.
xxiii. 17 is also addressed to him.

The young man on whose behalf Petrarch is writing was pjobably the
distinguished scholar Giovanni Malpaghini of Ravenna. Petrarch never
mentions his name, but implies that he was of Ravenna. There are two
main difficulties against this identification. Malpaghini was possibly not
born till about 1359 (according to Fam. xxiii. 19, Petrarch's young man was

born about 1346), and according to Coluccio Salutati he was with Petrarch y

for fifteen years. (See Salutati, Epistolario, iii, p. 537, where Novati con·-
cludes that the present young scholar was not Malpaghini.) But if there

’ was another distinguished scholar with Petrarch for fifteen years, itis very 'J

strange that there is no reference to him in the letters. For a further
