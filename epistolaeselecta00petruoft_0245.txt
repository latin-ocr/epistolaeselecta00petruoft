NOTES 229

Italy in 1354 had the result of bringing the Empire into further contempt
and providing Charles with funds at the expense of various Italian cities.
(see P. Orsi, Signorie e principati, pp. 96-100.) Petrarch's ideal of a peaceful
. Italy with the Emperor in Rome was no nearer fulfilment.

For another letter to Charles see Fam. xxiii. 8. Cf. perhaps also the
sonnet, Rime ccxxxviii. Petrarch's letters to Charles have been translated
into French by P. Mabille, P. et l'empereur Charles IV, op. cit.

Line 56. avo : his grandfather was the Emperor Henry V11. His father
was that John of Bohemia who was killed at Crecy, at which battle Charles

himself was also present.

23. From the Letter to Posterity we gather that the Latin epic Africa
was begun on Easter Saturday 1339, at Vaucluse. Part of it Petrarch read
to King Robert during his examination at Naples in 1341. He was again
working on it in Parma in the same year. In later years he became dis·
satisfied with the poem. In Sen. ii. 1 he tells Boccaccio how he had given
some lines of it to Barbato at Naples in 1343, and how Barbato had made
them known to his friends against Petrarch's wish. See also F. Novati,
Epis-talario di C. Salutati, Rome, 1891, ὅσα, vol. i, p. 229. There is an edition
of the poem by F . Corradini, Padua, 1874.

PAGE 78. Matteo Longo of Bergamo, Archdeacon of Liege, had been a
friend of Petrarch’s from his University days at Bologna. In Sen. xiii. 7,
written in 1372, Petrarch says he had not seen Matteo for twenty-three
years v3 therefore, unless Petrarch is making a mistake, this present letter,
written at Vaucluse, cannot have been written later than 1347, though
from its position among the other letters, we should expect it to have been
written in 1352, during Petrarch’s last year at Vaucluse.

born in 1337. In 1345 Petrarch had sent him to Rinaldo Cavalchini da
Villafranca (see G. Biadego, R. Cavalchim‘, in ⁴ Atti ’ of the ‘ Istituto Veneto ’
lviii, pp. 261-80) at Verona, and in 1348 removed him to a school at Parma

under Gilberto. In 1352 Petrarch obtained from Pope Clement VI a {fnonry - .¹
